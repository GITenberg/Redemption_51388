DELIVERANCE.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of
God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and
sanctification, and redemption.&rsquo;&mdash;1 <span
class="smcap">Cor</span>. i. 30.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is one of the happy characteristics of the present day that
persons are much more occupied than they used to be with the
subject of emotional religion.&nbsp; The religion of feeling is
much more studied than it was forty or fifty years ago.&nbsp;
Modern books and modern addresses abound in the records of what
is termed &lsquo;Experience.&rsquo;&nbsp; To a certain extent
this is well; for we all require real, deep, heart-religion, and
it would indeed be a shocking thing that we should know the truth
of God, and still be strangers to the love of Christ.&nbsp; Love,
joy, and peace, are the first fruits of the Spirit, and therefore
if God the <a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
2</span>Holy Ghost dwells in our hearts it seems clear that we
must love Him, that we must rejoice in Him, and that we must be
at peace resting in His grace.&nbsp; But, just in proportion as
we set a high value on the religion of the heart, must we see the
importance of a solid foundation of divine truth on which all
true heart-religion must ever rest.&nbsp; We cannot build a house
on the surface of a river.&nbsp; If we attempt to do so we shall
very soon find ourselves at the bottom.&nbsp; So feelings are
very apt to fail us just when we want them, if they are not the
result of a fixed and solid acquaintance with the truth of
God.&nbsp; If they do not spring from established principles they
will rise and fall even with the digestion or the weather.&nbsp;
It is, therefore, most important that in these happy days of
Christian emotion we should have a good foundation of Christian
truth, and should be well established in those great foundation
facts on which, when all feelings fail us, our souls may rest,
and be at peace.</p>
<p>It is well, therefore, that our attention should be directed
to the great foundation subject of Redemption.&nbsp; It is one on
which everything else hangs, for if we do not understand
redemption, we cannot possibly know the value of the <a
name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>Redeemer; and
if we do not know the Redeemer, where will our feelings be when
the time of pressure comes, and they are all pressed out of us by
trial?</p>
<p>There are three questions to be considered carefully at the
outset of our study.&nbsp; What is meant by Redemption?&nbsp; How
far is our redemption complete?&nbsp; And what is our present
position?&nbsp; May God the Holy Ghost both direct and bless the
words which shall be spoken!</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I.&nbsp; What is meant by redemption?</p>
<p>On this subject I cannot help thinking that there is sometimes
a good deal of confusion.&nbsp; People speak of it as if it were
the same as ransom, propitiation, or atonement, whereas there is
surely a great distinction between them.&nbsp; There cannot be a
doubt that the two are very closely connected: but redemption in
Scripture means much more than atonement, and always, or at all
events generally, includes the idea of deliverance, or
recovery.&nbsp; The word itself means to purchase back or to
recover by purchase; which clearly implies both the payment of
the price and the recovery of the purchased possession.&nbsp; If
a man were a prisoner in a foreign land, and a <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>ransom were
demanded for his release, there would be two distinct acts
necessary to his restoration; first the ransom must be paid, and
next the dungeon must be thrown open, and the captive brought out
as a freeman to his home.&nbsp; Now the first of these acts,
viz., the payment of the ransom, represents atonement, the ransom
price for the satisfaction of the law; but redemption includes
the actual deliverance as well.&nbsp; It is the payment of the
ransom, and also the actual liberation of the captive.&nbsp; When
the four living ones, and twenty-four elders said (Rev. v. 9),
&lsquo;Thou hast redeemed us to God by thy blood,&rsquo; they did
not mean merely that He had shed His blood for them in atonement,
but that He had actually gathered them out as a ransomed people,
and brought them from their former captivity to their present
joy; for they said, &lsquo;Thou hast redeemed us to God by thy
blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation;
and hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall
reign on the earth.&rsquo;&nbsp; Thus in the Old Testament the
idea of deliverance is far more prominent than that of
atonement.&nbsp; When it was written the doctrine of atonement
was not fully revealed, but was <a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>wrapped in types and prophecies.&nbsp;
But God&rsquo;s power in delivering was full in view, and it
became the prominent object in the thoughts of the writers.&nbsp;
Let us turn to a few passages in illustration.&nbsp; In Exod. vi.
6, we find God saying, &lsquo;I will bring you out from under the
burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their
bondage, and I will redeem you with a stretched-out arm, and with
great judgments.&rsquo;&nbsp; In Deut. vii. 8, Moses said,
&lsquo;The Lord brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed
you out of the house of bondmen, from the hand of Pharaoh, king
of Egypt.&rsquo;&nbsp; In Jer. xv. 21, when predicting the future
restoration of Israel, the Lord says by the prophet, &lsquo;I
will deliver them out of the hand of the wicked, and redeem them
out of the hand of the terrible.&rsquo;&nbsp; In all these
passages it is perfectly clear that &lsquo;to redeem&rsquo; means
&lsquo;to deliver;&rsquo; and that when God said, &lsquo;I will
redeem them,&rsquo; He meant that He would set them free.&nbsp;
And this is very clearly illustrated by the remarkable prophecy
of Isa. lix. 20, when compared with the quotation of it, Rom. xi.
26.&nbsp; In the prophecy our Blessed Lord and Saviour is called
&lsquo;the Redeemer,&rsquo; but in the apostolic quotation
&lsquo;the Deliverer.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Redeemer <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>is the
Deliverer, for &lsquo;He gave Himself for our sins that He might
deliver us from this present evil world.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the New Testament, however, there is a difference.&nbsp;
When that was written the ransom price had been paid, for the
Lord Jesus Christ had died; so that in it the atonement by the
Son of God becomes more prominent than the deliverance.&nbsp; The
blood of the Lamb is continually connected with redemption there,
as for example in such a passage as Titus, ii. 14, &lsquo;Who
gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity,
and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good
works;&rsquo; and in the words just quoted from Rev. v. 9,
&lsquo;Thou hast redeemed us to God by thy blood.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But both Old and New agree in teaching that redemption is
deliverance, or recovery, through a ransom or atonement.&nbsp; In
both &lsquo;to redeem&rsquo; combines the exercise of power with
the satisfaction of every lawful claim.&nbsp; It consists of two
parts, atonement and deliverance.&nbsp; Atonement, therefore, is
a part of redemption, but not the whole.&nbsp; It is the first
great act on which the subsequent deliverance depends, but it is
not the deliverance.&nbsp; Through atonement the satisfaction is
<a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>made for
sin, and by virtue of that satisfaction we are set free; and that
deliverance through atonement is the redemption of the
Gospel.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>II.&nbsp; We may proceed, then, to our second question.&nbsp;
How far is our redemption complete?&nbsp; And the answer to that
question is, that of the two parts the one is complete, but not
the other.</p>
<p>The ransom, or atonement, is complete, and there is no
possibility of adding anything to that, as in the words of our
Communion Service &lsquo;who made there (by His one oblation of
Himself once offered) a full, perfect and sufficient sacrifice,
oblation, and satisfaction for the sins of the whole
world,&rsquo; or, as in the words of Scripture, &lsquo;By one
offering he hath perfected for ever them that are
sanctified.&rsquo;&nbsp; That is done for ever and ever.&nbsp;
All the masses of the Church of Rome, and all that men call
sacrificial offering, can add nothing to it.&nbsp; All that they
can do is to throw a shade over its glory.&nbsp; Two hundred
million pounds were paid by conquered France as her ransom, and
of what use would it now be if any patriotic Frenchman should
endeavour to add to the security of his country by paying an
additional five shillings to the Prussians?&nbsp; So when <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>the precious
life of the Son of God has been laid down as our ransom, and when
God&rsquo;s covenant has been completely fulfilled, shall we now
go and add to it&mdash;a mass?</p>
<p>But the deliverance is not finished, and therefore in the
sense of deliverance the redemption is not yet complete.&nbsp;
The atonement was perfected on the cross, but the deliverance
will not be perfected till the Advent.&nbsp; Thus there are many
passages in which it is spoken of as still future.&nbsp; In St.
Luke, xxi. 28, our Lord said, &lsquo;When these things begin to
come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your
redemption draweth nigh.&rsquo;&nbsp; In Rom. viii. 23, those who
have the first-fruits of the Spirit are described as waiting for
&lsquo;the redemption of the body,&rsquo; or, in other words, for
the final deliverance of the body itself at the resurrection,
<i>i.e.</i>, for the gift promised through the prophet Hosea,
&lsquo;I will redeem them from death.&rsquo;&nbsp; So in the
Epistle to the Ephesians the saints are said both to have
redemption, and to be looking for it.&nbsp; In chap. i. 7, they
are described as having it.&nbsp; &lsquo;In whom we have
redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins according
to the riches of his grace,&rsquo; and in chap. iv. 30, as
waiting for it, &lsquo;Ye <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>are sealed unto the day of
redemption.&rsquo;&nbsp; The reason is that the atoning blood on
which forgiveness rests has been long since shed, and the
atonement perfected.&nbsp; He &lsquo;has redeemed us from the
curse of the law being made a curse for us.&rsquo;&nbsp; But the
final deliverance will not be complete till His return, when all
God&rsquo;s elect from all ages and all countries shall be all
gathered together in one, without a sorrow, and without a fear,
without death, without sin, without even a temptation to mar
their joy; one vast company ransomed by one atoning sacrifice
saved by one perfect Saviour, inheritors of one glorious kingdom,
and bound together in one heavenly fellowship in a blessed
eternity of never-ending joy.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>III.&nbsp; What, then, is our present position? of course I
mean the position of those that are really in Christ Jesus?&nbsp;
I think this may be very well illustrated by the words of Moses,
Exod. xv. 13: &lsquo;Thou in thy mercy hast led forth thy people
whom thou hast redeemed.&rsquo;&nbsp; Those people had been set
free from Egypt, and therefore were said to be redeemed.&nbsp;
They were already free, but they were not yet in Canaan, or
nearly so.&nbsp; They had not yet reached &lsquo;his <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>holy
habitation.&rsquo;&nbsp; But meanwhile they were in His hand, and
they might be perfectly sure that He would guide them every inch
of their way.</p>
<p>Now that appears to be exactly our position.&nbsp; If we be in
Christ Jesus we are already free.&nbsp; Our ransom has been paid,
our atonement completed, and we are free.&nbsp; We are free from
both the imputation and dominion of sin.&nbsp; From the
imputation, because the curse is gone; and from the dominion, for
we are not under the law but under grace.&nbsp; This part of
redemption is not a future thing which we should be always
seeking, and never finding; always praying for, and never
enjoying; always aiming at, but never reaching.&nbsp; It is the
present, blessed, sacred gift of every one of you that is in
Christ Jesus.&nbsp; You are not like Israel in bondage in Egypt,
nor even like Israel shut in by the rocks at Pi-hahiroth; but you
are like Israel on the eastern bank of the Red Sea, with Pharaoh
and his host sunk beneath the flood.&nbsp; The language of
Scripture twice repeated is, &lsquo;In whom we have redemption
through his blood, the forgiveness of sins.&rsquo;&nbsp; (Eph. i.
7; Col. i. 14.)&nbsp; Accept it then, and live in the joy of your
new position.&nbsp; Rejoice in the freedom and give thanks for
it.&nbsp; Let the past bondage be forgotten in the joy of <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>the liberty
wherewith Christ has made you free; and go forward with a
thankful heart to please Him who has thus graciously broken your
chain.</p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; But remember that you are not yet completely
delivered.&nbsp; Moses was so sure that the people would be
brought to the holy habitation that he praised God for it as if
it was already theirs, though they had many a long mile to
traverse, and many a hard battle to fight, before they reached
it.&nbsp; So you may be perfectly sure of it, for you are
&lsquo;sealed unto the day of redemption,&rsquo; and no one can
break the seal.&nbsp; That day of redemption is perfectly sure to
come, and you cannot be disappointed.&nbsp; But meanwhile you
have a journey, and a fight.&nbsp; To say nothing of all that is
around you, there are two things that you still carry within,
viz. death and sin.&nbsp; There is death, yes! that very death
that was overcome when the Lord Jesus rose from the dead, still
working secretly within you; and, if the day of redemption does
not come first, perfectly certain to bring you to the
grave.&nbsp; And there is sin, the deadly sin of your fallen
nature, not yet removed, but ready to poison the very fountains
of your soul.&nbsp; If you think you have done with either death
or sin, <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>you will be sorely disappointed before you have
travelled far.&nbsp; Your final redemption is not yet
completed.&nbsp; You are free from the curse, free from the
condemnation, free from the slavery, but you have not yet reached
home.&nbsp; You must not, therefore, lay aside your armour, nor
must you be disheartened even if you meet with that which makes
you groan, for we read in Rom. viii. 23, &lsquo;Even we
ourselves,&rsquo; which have the first-fruits of the Spirit,
&lsquo;groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit,
the redemption of our body.&rsquo;</p>
<p>(3.)&nbsp; But our delightful assurance is that all the while
we are safe in our Redeemer&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; He has delivered;
He will deliver; and He is delivering.&nbsp; Or, if we take the
word &lsquo;redeem&rsquo; in its full sense, He has redeemed; He
will redeem; and He is now redeeming.&nbsp; He has set us free by
His finished atonement.&nbsp; He will set us free by His
resurrection power; and He is now setting us free by the mighty
indwelling of God the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; See, then, the
unspeakable blessedness of such a text as that in Jerem. L. 34:
&lsquo;Their Redeemer is strong; the Lord of Hosts is his name:
he shall thoroughly plead their cause.&rsquo;&nbsp; He is our
Redeemer, for He <a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>has redeemed us by His blood: He is a strong Redeemer,
for He is the Lord of Hosts: He is a gracious Redeemer, for He
pleads for His people; and putting all together, He is a
perfectly sure Redeemer, so we will trust Him never to leave us
for a moment, till He give to every one of us a triumphant
victory, and present us sinless and deathless before His glorious
throne, saved by His grace, redeemed by His blood.</p>
<h2><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>II.&nbsp; ISRAEL.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Wherefore say unto the children of Israel,
I am the Lord, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of
the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I
will redeem you with a stretched-out arm, and with great
judgments.&rsquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Exod</span>. vi.
6.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou
hast redeemed: thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy

xv. 13.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">These</span> texts have a very important
connexion with each other.&nbsp; The first contains God&rsquo;s
promise when He appeared to Moses and promised deliverance to
Israel.&nbsp; The second is part of the thanksgiving of Moses
when the first portion of the promise had been fulfilled and
Israel was free.&nbsp; &lsquo;I will redeem,&rsquo; said
God.&nbsp; &lsquo;Thou hast redeemed,&rsquo; said Moses.&nbsp; Of
course both passages refer to the deliverance from Egypt, and
both show perfectly clearly that the word &lsquo;to redeem&rsquo;
means &lsquo;<i>to</i> deliver,&rsquo; and not merely to make
atonement, or satisfaction, for sin.&nbsp; They both, therefore,
<a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>throw
great light on the subject of redemption.</p>
<p>We know, on the authority of the New Testament, that the
redemption of Israel was typical of the great redemption of
God&rsquo;s people.&nbsp; But for my own part, I believe that it
was more than typical.&nbsp; I believe it is to be regarded as
the first great act of God in the redemption of His people.&nbsp;
Up to that time there had been no deliverance, or no
redemption.&nbsp; This was the first redemption in history, the
first act in the great series which will be finally completed at
the Advent, when death and hell shall be cast into the lake of
fire.&nbsp; I believe this to be the reason why, at the
commencement of it, God made Himself known by the name of
&lsquo;Jehovah.&rsquo;&nbsp; Many people think that the real
meaning of that sacred name is &lsquo;Yahveh,&rsquo; &lsquo;the
coming one.&rsquo;&nbsp; This &lsquo;coming one&rsquo; appears to
have been expected by Eve herself, and all the line of believing
patriarchs had lived and died in expectation of His advent.&nbsp;
But their hopes had not been realized, as the time had not come
for the manifestation of His power.&nbsp; But when Israel was in
the depths of his deep calamity, a bondsman in a foreign land and
far away from home, then God <a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>appeared to His chosen servant whom
He had raised up as His leader, and said to him, &lsquo;I am the
Yahveh, the coming one;&rsquo; and through him He promised to
Israel, &lsquo;I will redeem you with a stretched-out arm, and
with great judgments.&rsquo;</p>
<p>If this be the case, it gives a peculiar interest to the
narrative, because it shows that we are to regard this
deliverance of Israel as the act of the pre-existent
&lsquo;Coming One,&rsquo; the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of
God.&nbsp; It was not merely a type of the coming salvation; but
it was wrought by the same person who is now saving us, so that
we may see in it the actual commencement of the saving work of
our own beloved Redeemer.&nbsp; It was both a type and a
reality.&nbsp; It was a prophetic picture of what He was about to
do, and at the same time the commencement of His work as the
Deliverer.&nbsp; Let us, then, study it with care, and may He who
has redeemed us by His blood teach us by His Spirit!</p>
<p>You will remember that we found in the previous lecture, that
redemption is deliverance through ransom, and, therefore,
consists of two parts&mdash;the saving act and the atoning blood,
or, in other words, the power and the satisfaction.&nbsp; <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>Let us
consider both, as exhibited in the deliverance of Israel.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I.&nbsp; The saving act, or the power.</p>
<p>In studying this we cannot do better than follow the guidance
of Exod. vi. 6, where we learn that He saved them from their
burdens, from their bondage, and from inextricable
difficulties.</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; From their <i>burdens</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;I will
bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There are many burdens that weigh heavily on man, so that St.
Paul said, even when he was sealed by the Holy Ghost: &lsquo;We
that are in this tabernacle do groan being burdened.&rsquo;&nbsp;
There are burdens on the strength when a man has to toil beyond
his powers: burdens on the heart when we feel a weight of sorrow
as we witness the sufferings of those we love: burdens on the
thoughts when some heavy care rests upon us, and produces
depression of spirits: and, above all, burdens on the conscience
when the sense of sin troubles us, when we know we have been
wrong, and when the present conviction of our own utter
unworthiness weighs heavily on the heart.</p>
<p>These burdens come from many sources.&nbsp; <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>Sometimes
they are laid upon us by the providence of God, and sometimes
they are of our own creation.&nbsp; For example, the great pain
of the burden of sin is that we know it is our own fault, and,
therefore, it involves the bitter pain of self-reproach.</p>
<p>But some of these burdens are not always felt, or, if felt,
not really cared for.&nbsp; People are ready to complain of them;
but they are not really longing to be free.&nbsp; They are very
much like Israel in Egypt.&nbsp; Israel groaned and grumbled, but
yet when a deliverer came to them from God, they did not care to
be delivered.&nbsp; Turn to their words of reproach which they
spake to Moses when the Egyptians were pursuing them, Exod. xiv.
12, &lsquo;Is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt,
saying, Let us alone that we may serve the
Egyptians?&rsquo;&nbsp; They groaned a great deal, but yet they
wished to be let alone.&nbsp; They had no faith in delivering
power, so they preferred to bear their burden rather than run any
risk in their effort to be free.&nbsp; How many are there to this
day just like them, who confess their burden, who lament their
burden, who wish to be free of their burden, if they can be so
without difficulty, but who yet, when you tell them of the saving
<a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>power of
the Lord Jesus reply in their hearts, &lsquo;Let us
alone!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now remember that our blessed Lord and Saviour is a Saviour
from the burden, whatever the burden be.&nbsp; If He does not
take it away He will give you power to bear it.&nbsp; He is the
burden-bearer as well as the sin-bearer; and if He does not
remove the burden He is sure to sustain you under it, for He has
said, &lsquo;Cast thy burden on the Lord, and He shall sustain
thee.&rsquo;&nbsp; But He will one day remove the burden.&nbsp;
This is what He did for Israel.&nbsp; He promised to &lsquo;bring
them out from under their burdens,&rsquo; and He did it, and we
may trust Him to do the same by us.&nbsp; He will do it in His
own time, and His own way.&nbsp; &lsquo;The time appointed may be
long but the thing is true, and the day is coming when every
burden will be gone for ever, and the most burdened heart amongst
us will appear in perfect rest in the presence of the Lord.</p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; But He promised, also, to save them from their
<i>bondage</i>.&nbsp; They were bondsmen in Egypt.&nbsp; They
were not freemen, as we are, but slaves.&nbsp; They were not free
to choose their own master, or to come and go at their
pleasure.&nbsp; They could not leave their homes without the
permission of <a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>the king, for they were under a legal yoke.&nbsp; If
they had no work to do, nor any burdens laid on them, they would
still have been bondsmen.&nbsp; Moses was brought up in all the
luxury of a palace; but still he was a slave.&nbsp; So, when God
undertook to deliver, the first thing He did was to break the
bondage of this legal yoke.&nbsp; He set them free that He might
bring them out, and save them.&nbsp; So long as they were in
bondage they could not move, so He broke the chain and they were
free.&nbsp; Can anything be more complete as a type of what He
does for us?&nbsp; Those whom God hath not set free are
&lsquo;all their lifetime subject to bondage.&rsquo;&nbsp; They
are bound by what St. Paul describes, Rom. viii. 2, as &lsquo;the
law of sin and death.&rsquo;&nbsp; So long as the guilt of
unforgiven sin rests on the conscience, they cannot be
free.&nbsp; It matters not where they are or what they are
doing.&nbsp; They may be bowed down by hard work, or living in
ease and idleness; but in either case they are bondsmen, and they
are condemned under the law, and bound by it.&nbsp; They cannot
shake it off, or get clear of it, for it is a condemnation by God
Himself, and they cannot break His chain.&nbsp; Indeed, their
efforts to get free very frequently produce just the same <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>result as the
efforts of Israel did when they strove to get free from
Pharaoh.&nbsp; The only result of their effort was that the
burden became heavier, and the bondage more severe.&nbsp; How
often is this the case with persons struggling to get free from
the burden and bondage of sin!&nbsp; They try, and try again, and
the only result is, that they get deeper into difficulty.&nbsp;
They have at last to make their bricks without the straw, and
seem worse off than ever.&nbsp; But then it is that the Redeemer
appears, and says, &lsquo;I will rid them out of their
bondage.&rsquo;&nbsp; He has borne the burden, and having done so
He breaks the yoke.&nbsp; He removes the imputation of sin, and
when that is gone we are free, free to arise and follow Him; free
to go forth to the promised land; free to walk fearlessly with
God; free because &lsquo;Christ has made us free;&rsquo; because
&lsquo;the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made us
free from the law of sin and death.&rsquo;</p>
<p>(3.)&nbsp; But once more; He delivered them from what, as far
as man was concerned, were insuperable <i>difficulties</i>.</p>
<p>It is not an uncommon thing to meet with persons who really
hope that they are delivered from the imputation of sin, and
therefore free <a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>from the bondage of the law, who still feel the greatest
difficulty in their progress in a Christian life.&nbsp; They
really hope that a great change has taken place.&nbsp; They are
in a very different position to what they once were.&nbsp; But
still they cannot get on.&nbsp; It appears as if there was a
barrier they could not pass.&nbsp; Their way is blocked by some
besetting sin which they cannot overcome, and they are sometimes
almost tempted to say that it was better with them before they
began their struggle.&nbsp; Such a temptation is very wrong; but
there is nothing new in it, for it is just what Israel felt when
they found their way blocked by the Red Sea.&nbsp; They then said
(chap, xiv. 12), &lsquo;It had been better for us to serve the
Egyptians than to die in the wilderness.&rsquo;&nbsp; They had
been set free, but progress appeared impossible.&nbsp; Now let
any one who thinks his own progress impossible look well at these
facts.&nbsp; It was perfectly true that those people were
hopelessly hedged in between the sea and Pharaoh&rsquo;s
host.&nbsp; There was nothing that they could do to overcome
their difficulty.&nbsp; But Jehovah had promised, &lsquo;I will
redeem you with a stretched-out arm,&rsquo; and the result was
that when Moses stretched forth his rod, the sea itself opened to
let them <a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>pass.&nbsp; Some excellent persons have endeavoured to
explain this by supposing some remarkable combination of wind and
tide.&nbsp; But we do not want the help of such
explanations.&nbsp; It is better to accept it at once as a
miracle that cannot be explained, a miracle wrought out by the
strong arm of the Redeemer.&nbsp; And, remember, that it is the
same strong arm which can deliver the very weakest amongst us
from the greatest difficulties which ever yet beset the path of
the Christian.&nbsp; You say, &lsquo;I cannot,&rsquo; but He
says, &lsquo;<i>I</i> can.&rsquo;&nbsp; You say, &lsquo;I have
tried; and it is impossible.&rsquo;&nbsp; He says, &lsquo;With
God nothing is impossible.&rsquo;&nbsp; Never, therefore, again
must you say, &lsquo;It cannot be.&rsquo;&nbsp; If the Lord has
set you free from the dreadful yoke of imputed sin; if the
Redeemer Himself is leading you to the promised land, remember
that your &lsquo;Redeemer is strong, the Lord of Hosts is His
name;&rsquo; and whatever be your practical, personal, peculiar
difficulty, He is just as well able to overcome it as He was to
divide the Red Sea: so that, trusting Him you may be delivered as
Israel was delivered, and be enabled, with a thankful heart to
say, &lsquo;Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people whom thou
hast redeemed.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>II.&nbsp; But we must not look only at the deliverance,
for redemption means deliverance through ransom, or through
blood, and we must not forget the ransom, or redemption
price.&nbsp; What in this case was the ransom?&nbsp; It was not
Pharaoh&rsquo;s host drowned in the Red Sea, for the bondage of
Israel was broken before that event occurred.&nbsp; Nor was it
the death of the first-born in Egypt, for that could not be
regarded as the ransom of Israel, though I fully admit that it
was closely connected with it.&nbsp; For my own part I believe it
was the blood of the Paschal Lamb on the night of the
Passover.&nbsp; But you may say what a little thing that was as
the ransom of a nation!&nbsp; Perfectly true; but remember, it
was a type.&nbsp; The whole transaction was a type.&nbsp; The
people were a type; the deliverance was a type; and, therefore,
it is only natural to expect that the ransom, too, would be a
type.&nbsp; Now we learn that the Paschal Lamb was a type of our
blessed Saviour, for we read, 1 Cor. v. 7, &lsquo;Christ our
passover is sacrificed for us,&rsquo; and, therefore, as that
paschal lamb was a prophetic picture of Him and His sacrifice, we
can see in a moment how it was that it was the ransom price in
the redemption of Israel.&nbsp; It was an antedating of <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>the future
sacrifice of the Son of God, and it, as it were, carried back the
power of the great atonement, and applied it 1500 years before it
happened to the redemption of Israel.&nbsp; I can see, therefore,
perfectly clearly why the deliverance of Israel was called a
redemption; for they were redeemed by the same ransom as we are
even by the precious blood of Christ.&nbsp; It was shed, it is
true, 1500 years after their deliverance, but even then it was
prefigured and applied, and even then it was effectual.&nbsp;
What, then, is our conclusion?&nbsp; Is it not surely this?&nbsp;
If the burden of Israel was removed, the yoke of Egypt broken,
the way opened through the Red Sea, and all through the type, may
not we be perfectly sure that our burdens will be removed, our
yoke broken, and our difficulty overcome through the effectual
power of the reality?&nbsp; Look, then, at that most precious
blood of Christ; look at Him as the Lamb of God that taketh away
the sins of the world; look at Him as your ransom and Deliverer,
and never again admit the thought that the yoke of sin&rsquo;s
condemning power is too fast fixed ever to be broken, or the
hindrances of sin&rsquo;s obstructing power too desperate to be
overcome.&nbsp; But when you groan under the yoke let your heart
rest in <a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>redeeming blood; and when you feel the difficulty of
progress then look to redeeming power, so that the yoke being
broken through the blood, and victory given by the power, you may
go on your way with the song of Moses in your heart, &lsquo;The
Lord is my strength and song, and he is become my
salvation.&rsquo;</p>

27</span>III.&nbsp; THE FIRST-BORN.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;But the firstling of an ass thou shalt
redeem with a lamb: and if thou redeem him not, then shalt thou
break his neck.&nbsp; All the firstborn of thy sons thou shalt
redeem.&nbsp; And none shall appear before me
empty.&rsquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Exod</span>. xxxiv.
20.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Man</span> is a very forgetful being, and
there is nothing which he seems to forget so much as mercy.&nbsp;
It takes a great deal to make us forget a trouble, but very
little to wipe away the thought of mercy.&nbsp; Thus when God has
wrought great acts He has not unfrequently appointed memorials in
order to keep them in remembrance, and has provided for the
failure of man&rsquo;s memory by appointing something that may
continually remind him of the past.&nbsp; Sometimes it has been a
stone or monument, as, <i>e.g.</i> at the passage of Jordan, but
more frequently it has been an institution, such as the Paschal
Supper as a memorial of the Passover, <a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>and the Holy Communion, or the Supper
of the Lord, in remembrance of His death and passion.&nbsp; These
institutions have lasted much longer than the material
monuments.&nbsp; The Paschal Supper lasted fifteen centuries, and
the Lord&rsquo;s Supper has already lasted more than
eighteen.&nbsp; It seems a very simple institution.&nbsp; What
can be more simple than to partake together of a little bread and
wine in thankful remembrance of His death?&nbsp; But it has never
been forgotten by the people of God, and never will be till the
Advent.&nbsp; Wherever Christ has been preached this memorial
feast has been observed.&nbsp; In all ages and all countries it
has been the joy of God&rsquo;s people.&nbsp; In all
mission-stations as well as in our churches at home, always and
everywhere, the sacred memorial has been reverently and lovingly
observed by those who name the name of Jesus.</p>
<p>But besides the Paschal Supper there was another institution
ordained as a remembrance of the deliverance from Egypt.&nbsp;
For as Israel was delivered through the death of the first-born
of the Egyptians, it was established as a law in Israel that all
their first-born both of man and beast should be given up to
God.&nbsp; The law is <a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>given, and the reason of it, in Exod.
xiii.&nbsp; In v. 2, we find the law, &lsquo;Sanctify unto me all
the first-born, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of
Israel, both of man and beast: it is mine;&rsquo; and in v. 14,
the reason, &lsquo;And it shall be, when thy son asketh thee in
time to come saying, What is that? that thou shalt say to him, By
strength of hand the Lord brought us out from Egypt from the
house of bondage;&rsquo; and in the 16th verse we are taught that
it was for a perpetual memorial before God, &lsquo;And it shall
be for a token upon thy hand, and for frontlets between thine
eyes: for by strength of hand the Lord brought us out from
Egypt.&rsquo;</p>
<p>We are not told what was involved in this separation unto God
of the first-born of the sons.&nbsp; Some think, and not without
reason, that they were separated unto the priesthood, but on this
we have no distinct information.&nbsp; One thing is clear, that
in some peculiar manner they were the Lord&rsquo;s.&nbsp; In
Exod. xxii. 29, &lsquo;The first-born of thy sons thou shalt give
unto me.&rsquo;&nbsp; So in Num. iii. 13, &lsquo;Because all the
first-born are mine.&rsquo;&nbsp; Was there not an allusion to
this in Hannah&rsquo;s words when she said, &lsquo;I will give
him unto the Lord all the days of his life&rsquo;? and was <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>there not
again a distinct reference to it in the presentation of our
Blessed Saviour to the temple, as we read in Luke, ii. 23?&nbsp;
In the case of Samuel and our Blessed Lord there was clearly a
consecration to a special and exclusive service; so whatever was
the precise form of separation, one thing is perfectly clear,
that in a peculiar and especial manner the first-born were set
apart unto God.&nbsp; There was a vast difference between
God&rsquo;s ordinance and man&rsquo;s habit.&nbsp; It is a very
common thing with man to devote the first-born to the world, and
the second, third, or fourth son to the ministry; or, extending
the principle, to consider that which is second in our own
affections to be good enough for God.&nbsp; But He claims the
first of all, that which is the first to bring joy to the
mother&rsquo;s heart, and which is first to claim the
mother&rsquo;s love; that which has for a time the concentrated
interest of the only child.&nbsp; The Jewish parent was not to
wait till he had many.&nbsp; It was when the mother had only one,
that that one was to be given to God.</p>
<p>But it is the redemption of the first-born which we are now to
study.&nbsp; In this verse we are told, &lsquo;All the first-born
of thy sons thou <a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>shalt redeem.&rsquo;&nbsp; According to the law there
was a legal claim on every first-born, whether of man or animal,
but still there was provision made in most cases for their
redemption or release, and it is to this provision that I am
anxious now to turn your thoughts.</p>
<p>It differed in different classes.</p>
<p>For sacrificial animals, such as the sheep, or the goat, there
was no redemption.&nbsp; They were all offered in sacrifice, Num.
xviii. 17, &lsquo;But the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of
a sheep, or the firstling of a goat, thou shalt not redeem; they
are holy: thou shalt sprinkle their blood upon the altar, and
shalt burn their fat for an offering made by fire, for a sweet
savour unto the Lord.&rsquo;</p>
<p>For other useful animals, such as the ass, there was
redemption.&nbsp; The ass might be redeemed by a lamb, but if it
was not redeemed, its neck was to be broken, Exod. xxxiv.
20.&nbsp; &lsquo;But the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem
with a lamb: and if thou redeem him not, then thou shalt break
his neck.&rsquo;&nbsp; If redeemed, it was saved from death by
substitution.&nbsp; It was redeemed by vicarious death.&nbsp; The
lamb was the substitute for the colt, so the lamb died, and the
colt was free.&nbsp; You see how the principle of <a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>substitution
pervades the prophecies of the Jewish ritual.</p>
<p>The same principle of substitution appears in the redemption
of the first-born sons.&nbsp; But there is a marked difference
between that made for them, and that for the animals, viz., that
the law did not admit the idea of any such thing as human
sacrifice, and therefore the sons were not like the animals
subject to death.&nbsp; They belonged to God for service, not for
death, and the redemption price was of the same character as the
yoke from which they were redeemed.&nbsp; Thus you find the whole
tribe of Levi given up as the redemption price of the first-born
of the other tribes.&nbsp; The transaction is explained, Num.
iii. 41.&nbsp; &lsquo;Thou shalt take the Levites for me (I am
the Lord) instead of all the first-born among the children of
Israel.&rsquo;&nbsp; Thus all the men amongst the Levites were
numbered, and all the first-born amongst the other tribes, and by
divine authority the Levites were solemnly given up as a
substitute for the others, Num. iii 45: &lsquo;Take the Levites
instead of all the first-born among the children of Israel, and
the cattle of the Levites instead of their cattle: and the
Levites shall be mine: I am the Lord.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>But
here a difficulty arose, and it is one which teaches us the
extreme danger of giving a typical authority to all the
institutions of the Old Testament.&nbsp; There was clearly in
this case the principle of substitution.&nbsp; The Levites were
substituted for the first-born, and the first-born were
free.&nbsp; The transaction was, therefore, an illustration of
the work of the atonement.&nbsp; But yet if we were to regard it
as a divine type of it we should be landed in a most dangerous
and unscriptural conclusion, for in the case of the first-born
the substituted gift was insufficient; so that if we were to call
those Levites a type of the Lord Jesus, we might gather that His
sacrifice was insufficient, and required something else as a
supplement.&nbsp; Be very careful, therefore, how you call
anything a type which is not declared to be one by God
Himself.</p>
<p>When the Levites were numbered it turned out that there were
only 22,000; but the number of the first-born males of the other
tribes was 22,273.&nbsp; The substitution, therefore, fell short
by 273 persons.&nbsp; It clearly, therefore, could be no type of
the Lord Jesus, for there was no falling short in Him.&nbsp; The
result was that a supplement was necessary.&nbsp; Five shekels of
silver was to be <a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>added for each of the 273, and when that was paid the
whole of the first-born were redeemed.&nbsp; This money payment
afterwards became a permanent institution in Israel, and appears
to have been continued long after the original transaction was
complete.&nbsp; In Num. xviii. 16, we find the direction that
&lsquo;all that are to be redeemed . . . shalt thou redeem . . .
for the money of five shekels, after the shekel of the
sanctuary.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now in this Levitical picture there are many things that bear
a close resemblance to the Gospel.&nbsp; There was a clear legal
claim, and the remission of that claim by substitution, or the
payment of a redemption price.&nbsp; And this may serve to
illustrate the claim which the law has on us all, and the
remission of the claim by the substitution of the Son of
God.&nbsp; But, as I have already said, we must be very careful
how we call it a type, for the contrasts are more remarkable than
the resemblances.&nbsp; There are two points of contrast to which
I would draw your most especial attention, points which I can
scarcely doubt you have yourselves observed already.</p>
<p>In the first place, the freedom or the release bestowed on the
first-born through redemption <a name="page35"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>was the exact opposite of that
bestowed on us through the redemption that is in Christ
Jesus.&nbsp; They were redeemed <i>from</i> God; but we are
redeemed <i>to</i> God, as we read Rev. v. 9, &lsquo;Thou hast
redeemed us to God by thy blood, out of every kindred, and
tongue, and people, and nation.&rsquo;&nbsp; Before they were
redeemed, all the first-born were the Lord&rsquo;s, and were
enrolled as a separate people belonging in a special and peculiar
manner to Him; so that He said of them, Num. iii. 13, &lsquo;All
the first-born are mine.&rsquo;&nbsp; The effect of the
redemption was to put an end to this sacred relationship, and to
place them on the same footing as the other members of the
family.&nbsp; It released them from all that was involved in
their being a peculiar people unto God.&nbsp; They ceased, in
short, to be a peculiar people.&nbsp; Now this is the exact
reverse of the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.&nbsp; The
effect of His work is to call out a peculiar people unto God, and
so separate us unto Himself, that He may say of us, as He said of
the first-born, &lsquo;All are mine.&rsquo;&nbsp; You remember
how clearly this is put in Titus, ii. 14, &lsquo;Who gave himself
for us.&rsquo;&nbsp; There is the redemption price, and the next
clause teaches the object of it, &lsquo;that he might <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>redeem us
from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people,
zealous of good works.&rsquo;&nbsp; Those, therefore, whom he has
redeemed are purified as &lsquo;a peculiar people unto
himself.&rsquo;&nbsp; We are brought by redemption into the
position from which the first-born were delivered.&nbsp; And I
cannot help thinking that there is an allusion to this fact in
that great description of the Christian&rsquo;s position in Heb
xii.&nbsp; We there read, in ver. 23, that we are come &lsquo;to
the general assembly and church of the first-born which are
written in heaven.&rsquo;&nbsp; What is the meaning of that
expression?&nbsp; Why are believers called the first-born, and
why were their names thus written?&nbsp; Is it not because they
are brought into the same peculiar relationship to God which was
the inheritance of the first-born?&nbsp; Because, as the
first-born were His own so are we?&nbsp; And because as they were
enrolled as being His in the national register, so are we in the
book of life?&nbsp; And is there any one amongst us that would
wish to be free from that peculiarity?&nbsp; Is there one that
has ever knelt down in the fulness of his heart and said,
&lsquo;Lord, I am thine,&rsquo; who would now rise up and say,
&lsquo;But I wish to be thine no more&rsquo;?&nbsp; Is there any
one <a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>who
has ever borne the yoke of the Lord Jesus who would now wish to
throw it off, and be free?&nbsp; No, never!&nbsp; We wish to be
free from all that keeps us back from Him; free from every weight
and from the sin which doth so easily beset us: free from every
temptation that tends to hinder us in His service.&nbsp; But free
from Christ!&nbsp; Never, never, never!&nbsp; The desire of our
heart is to be His altogether; His without reserve; His in the
exercise of all our powers; His in life; His in death; His for
eternity; His whatever may be given up for His service; His, so
completely, so truly, so heartily, that we may be able to say in
the sincerity of our souls, &lsquo;Whether we live, we live unto
the Lord, and whether we die, we die unto the Lord; whether we
live, therefore, or die, we are the Lord&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But there is another most marked point of contrast to which I
have already alluded, but which we ought to consider more
carefully before we close.&nbsp; There was an essential
difference of character between the redemption price in the case
of the first-born and in ours.&nbsp; In theirs there was no
shedding of blood.&nbsp; There was substitution, but not
blood-shedding.&nbsp; The life of the child was not forfeited to
the law, so <a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>the life of the substitute was not taken in its
stead.&nbsp; It was a gift of service for service, the service of
the Levite for the service of the child.&nbsp; Then again it was
a mixed, and composite substitution.&nbsp; The substitution of
the Levites was insufficient, so the defect was made up by the
1365 shekels of silver.&nbsp; But in our case, as our lives were
forfeited by sin, His life was given in our stead; and who shall
say that it was insufficient?&nbsp; May we not rather say,
&lsquo;She hath received at the Lord&rsquo;s hand double for all
her sins,&rsquo; for &lsquo;with Him is plenteous
redemption?&rsquo;&nbsp; We have no need to supplement His
sacrifices by silver.&nbsp; It appears that St. Peter had
reference to this very contrast and to those supplemented
shekels, when he said, 1 Pet. i. 18, &lsquo;Forasmuch as ye know
that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and
gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your
fathers: but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb
without blemish and without spot.&rsquo;&nbsp; Some people might
possibly think more of redemption if the redemption price
consisted of gold and silver, for they seem to care more for
money than for the most precious blood of Christ; at all events,
<a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>they
appear to cling much faster to it.&nbsp; But what can money do
for you when you are face to face with God?&nbsp; And what can
man do for you when your conscience is bowed down by the weight
of sin?&nbsp; No vicarious work of other men, and no gifts,
however great, can set you free from the yoke and condemnation of
the law.&nbsp; That will never enable you to say, as was said to
me last week by one well known to many of you, &lsquo;The whole
weight is gone.&rsquo;&nbsp; No, indeed!&nbsp; All the Levitical
service that conscientious men may offer to God, and all the
accumulated wealth that the richest amongst us may tender as a
redemption price, will all together utterly fail to take the
weight from one sin-burdened soul.&nbsp; But the precious blood
of Christ, of Christ Jesus the one divinely-appointed substitute,
that is enough; enough, though quite alone, enough to redeem us
from the whole curse, and to redeem us from it for ever, that so,
by His boundless grace, we may be set apart as the first-born
unto God, and live and die amongst those who are written in
heaven.</p>

40</span>IV.&nbsp; THE BONDSMAN.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;After that he is sold he may be redeemed
again; one of his brethren may redeem him.&rsquo;&mdash;Lev. xxv.
48.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> blessed Lord said in the Sermon
on the Mount, &lsquo;Think not that I am come to destroy the law
or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to
fulfil.&rsquo;&nbsp; He did not come as a sweeping reformer to
break down existing institutions, and sweep away the law of
types; but He did come as the predicted Messiah, to fulfil the
prophecies of those prophetic pictures, and to give a fresh
dignity to the law in which they were embodied.&nbsp; In no
instance, therefore, do you find Him violating the law.&nbsp; He
swept away with a strong hand the vain traditions which men had
added to it; but the law itself he always honoured, and His great
complaint against the advocates of tradition was, &lsquo;Ye do
make void the commandments of the law by your
traditions.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>But it
was not only in the practical details of life that He honoured
the law, but in the whole great work of redemption.&nbsp; Every
part of that wonderful work was an act of homage to the
law.&nbsp; Not only did He obey it when He was come, but in the
act of coming, or in other words, even in His incarnation, He
showed His obedience.</p>
<p>This will be easily seen if you study the law of redemption as
laid down in this chapter.&nbsp; The law is here given respecting
one who had sold himself to a stranger.&nbsp; How many are there
who, like the bondsman, have sold themselves to sin!&nbsp; But we
must not stop to dwell on that.&nbsp; The poor man had sold
himself and was a slave.&nbsp; Till the year of jubilee nothing
could release him but redemption.&nbsp; But who should pay the
redemption price? that was the question.&nbsp; A stranger was not
at liberty to do so.&nbsp; However kindly disposed he might feel,
he had no right or power to interfere.&nbsp; According to this
48th verse, the Redeemer must be one of his brethren.&nbsp;
&lsquo;One of his brethren may redeem him: either his uncle or
his uncle&rsquo;s son may redeem him, or any that is nigh of kin
unto him of his family, may redeem him; or, if he be able, he may
redeem <a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>himself.&rsquo;&nbsp; The slave himself might redeem
himself if he had the power to do so.&nbsp; But what hope had
that slave of procuring his own ransom when all his powers and
all his time belonged to another?&nbsp; Who then could redeem
him?&nbsp; Who could set him free?</p>
<p>The nearest of kin had the prior right, as we see in the case
of Boaz and Ruth.&nbsp; But if he failed, the next in order of
relationship might step in and take his place.&nbsp; But the
redeemer must be a kinsman, and none but a kinsman could
redeem.&nbsp; So closely are the two things identified, that
redeemer and kinsman are both expressed by the same word in
Hebrew.&nbsp; The same word stands for both, for the kinsman had
the right of redemption, and the redeemer was obliged to have a
blood relationship.</p>
<p>And now observe the manner in which our blessed Lord and
Saviour obeyed the law.</p>
<p>We are all by nature in the position of the man that was
sold.&nbsp; So St. Paul said of himself in his natural condition,
&lsquo;I am carnal, sold under sin,&rsquo; Rom. vii. 14; and
therefore he described the law of evil within his nature warring
against the law of his mind, &lsquo;and bringing him into
captivity to the law of sin which was in <a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>his
members.&rsquo;&nbsp; There was therefore a captivity resulting
from the sale.</p>
<p>But it is not only the original ruin of our human nature of
which the expression is used in Scripture, for it is applied to
the personal act of the individual sinner.&nbsp; Is there not an
allusion to this very law in those passages which speak of
persons having sold themselves?&nbsp; Ahab &lsquo;sold himself to
do evil.&rsquo;&nbsp; 1 Kings, xxi. 20.&nbsp; In 2 Kings, xvii.
17, the same is said of the children of Israel: &lsquo;They sold
themselves to do evil in the sight of the Lord.&rsquo;&nbsp; In
Isaiah, L. 1, there is a distinct reference to the sale to a
creditor,&mdash;&lsquo;Which of my creditors is it to whom I have
sold you?&nbsp; Behold, for your iniquities have ye sold
yourselves, and for your transgressions is your mother put
away.&rsquo;&nbsp; And in Isa. lii. 3, a clear allusion to the
redemption of the slave, &lsquo;Ye have sold yourselves for
nought; and ye shall be redeemed without money.&rsquo;&nbsp; The
sinner, therefore, is like the man who sold himself.&nbsp; He has
yielded himself to be the servant of sin.&nbsp; He obeys it, and
he does its work.&nbsp; If he wishes to get free he cannot.&nbsp;
He may long for liberty, but he cannot attain it.&nbsp; He may
think with bitter regret of past folly that has led to his
ruin.&nbsp; But regret cannot restore.&nbsp; Remorse <a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>cannot set
him free.&nbsp; A slave he is, and a slave, unless saved by
redemption, he must remain.</p>
<p>How, then, can such an one be redeemed?&nbsp; That is the
question.&nbsp; It must clearly be by a redemption price.&nbsp;
There was no redemption under the law without a ransom.&nbsp; In
the case of the man who had sold himself, the price was the value
of his service until the year of jubilee.&nbsp; In our case it
was infinitely higher, for the Lord Jesus gave Himself &lsquo;a
ransom for all.&rsquo;&nbsp; The sinner sold himself, and the
Lord Jesus gave Himself as a ransom, and because He has done so,
God said by the prophet, &lsquo;Ye shall be redeemed without
money.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But my object is to consider, not the ransom, but the
Redeemer, and to examine who, according to the law, was qualified
to redeem.</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; We cannot redeem ourselves.</p>
<p>It is clear that according to ver. 49, the slave, if he were
able, might redeem himself.&nbsp; But it must have been very
difficult for a slave, who had sold himself because he was
ruined, to accumulate sufficient for his own redemption; and it
is perfectly clear that it would be utterly impossible for us to
accomplish any such redemption for ourselves.&nbsp; Multitudes
have <a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>endeavoured to do so.&nbsp; They have striven to gain a
freedom by tears and toils, and fastings, and almsdeeds,
proportioned to the sin committed.&nbsp; But the only effect has
been that the chain has been riveted more firmly than ever on
their soul.&nbsp; Instead of providing a ransom they have daily
increased their debt.&nbsp; And so it will ever be so long as man
struggles to redeem himself.&nbsp; &lsquo;It cost more to redeem
their souls, so they must let that alone for ever.&rsquo;</p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; Then again, angels could not redeem us.&nbsp; Even
if there had been any mighty archangel of such majesty as to
produce a sufficient ransom, he would have been disqualified for
the office, for the simple reason that he would not have been a
kinsman.&nbsp; We know but little of the nature of angels, and we
cannot realize a mighty spirit perfectly independent of the
flesh.&nbsp; But this we know, that there is a clear and marked
distinction between the nature of angels and the nature of man,
for we read of our blessed Saviour, &lsquo;He took not on him the
nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of
Abraham.&rsquo;&nbsp; Heb. ii. 16.&nbsp; The angels, therefore,
are not our brethren.&nbsp; They are not kinsmen, and therefore
were not qualified to redeem.&nbsp; Whatever benevolence <a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>they may have
felt, and whatever compassion for us in our captivity, and
whatever joy in our salvation, the whole host of angels and
archangels were utterly disqualified to act as redeemers, and,
whatever they offered, according to the law, they were unable to
redeem.</p>
<p>(3.)&nbsp; But still more.&nbsp; Even the Son of God Himself,
in His eternal Godhead, could not redeem, for there lay against
Him the same disqualification.&nbsp; He was eternal, above man,
and of a nature altogether different.&nbsp; As the heaven is high
above the earth, so is His nature above ours.&nbsp; It is high,
we cannot attain unto it.&nbsp; In His divine nature, therefore,
our blessed Lord Himself was not a kinsman, and therefore by law
He could not be a Redeemer.&nbsp; He was not one of the brethren
of the bondsmen, and therefore could not redeem; and, whatever
love He felt for us, He was excluded, according to the law, from
showing it in redeeming mercy.</p>
<p>And now you see the homage paid to the law in His
incarnation.&nbsp; When He took on Him our nature He became a
kinsman, and could redeem.&nbsp; See how clearly this is put in
Heb. ii. 14.&nbsp; &lsquo;Forasmuch as the children are partakers
of flesh and <a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same;
that through death he might destroy him that had the power of
death, that is, the devil.&rsquo;&nbsp; He identified Himself
with them in nature in order that, being their kinsman, He might
have the right of redemption.&nbsp; He took not on Him the nature
of angels, for that would not have established a relationship
with man, but He took on Him the seed of Abraham, and so became
one with the great human family.&nbsp; The Levitical law, ver.
48, was, &lsquo;One of his brethren may redeem him.&rsquo;&nbsp;
So to carry out His own most gracious purpose of mercy, He took
our nature, He made Himself a brother, and according to the 11th
verse of that chapter in the Hebrews, &lsquo;He is not ashamed to
call us brethren.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Just the same truth is taught us in Gal. iv.&nbsp; In ver. 3,
we are described as bondsmen: &lsquo;We were in bondage under the
elements of the world.&rsquo;&nbsp; And when our Heavenly Father
in boundless love undertook to save, what did He do?&nbsp; He
first prepared a qualified Redeemer, and then that Redeemer
redeemed us by His blood.&nbsp; &lsquo;He sent forth his son,
made of a woman, made under the law,&rsquo; qualified therefore
in all respects, because He was of the same family &lsquo;to <a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>redeem them
that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of
sons.&rsquo;&nbsp; He became a brother, and, being a brother,
redeemed us by His blood.&nbsp; There was a double act of love
and mercy: first, in assuming the relationship, and next, in
availing himself of that relationship in stepping forth to pay
the ransom for our release.&nbsp; Oh! who can tell the love of
Christ?&nbsp; Who can sufficiently exalt His grace?</p>
<p>But now what is the position of all those that are in
Him?&nbsp; What is the position of all you who have redemption
through His blood?&nbsp; You were bondsmen once; sold under sin:
sold by the act of Adam, and sold by your own conduct
afterwards.&nbsp; As St. Paul says, Rom. vi. 17, &lsquo;Ye were
the servants&rsquo; or the slaves &lsquo;of sin.&rsquo;&nbsp; But
what are you now?&nbsp; Are you still slaves?&nbsp; No.&nbsp;
Those only who are strangers to salvation in Christ Jesus are
slaves.&nbsp; But you are not, for you are free.&nbsp; Your
kinsman has appeared and paid the redemption price; so you are
free: as completely free as if you had never been in
bondage.&nbsp; The moment that the kinsman paid the ransom, the
slave was free.&nbsp; He was not required to stop and inquire
whether he deserved it or no.&nbsp; He was not obliged to wait
and look <a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>into his feelings, and ascertain whether he felt it or
no.&nbsp; The ransom was paid, and he was free, so that he might
go home with a thankful heart to show his deep gratitude to the
kinsman who had paid it.&nbsp; So it is with you if you be in
Christ Jesus.&nbsp; The creditor has no hold on you, for your
kinsman has come forward, and the whole ransom is paid.&nbsp; You
are as completely free as you will be if you wait a hundred
years.&nbsp; You cannot add anything to the ransom, and there is
no need that you should do so, for all is paid, and paid in
full.&nbsp; You may dwell therefore in perfect peace in your
Father&rsquo;s home, and with a thankful heart gather round your
Father&rsquo;s table, in the peaceful enjoyment of your
Father&rsquo;s fellowship, and your Father&rsquo;s love.</p>
<p>But think how strange it would have been in olden times, if,
when the kinsman had come forward and most kindly paid the
redemption price, the poor bondsman had preferred captivity, and
refused the liberty thus freely purchased for him by his
brother.&nbsp; Such things apparently did happen sometimes,
though they appear to us almost impossible; for, in Exod. xxi. 5,
the servant is described as plainly saying, &lsquo;I love <a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>my master . .
.&nbsp; I will not go out free,&rsquo; and, when he said that he
was taken to the door-post, and his ear was bored through in
token that he was a slave for life.&nbsp; I do not know whether
that often happened in ancient days, but I fear it is a very
common occurrence now.&nbsp; The Son of God has become a kinsman
on purpose to redeem, and as a kinsman has redeemed us by His
blood.&nbsp; He has come to the master, and having broken all his
legal power, has proclaimed liberty to the captive, and the
opening of the prison to them that are bound; but there sits the
slave, content in his slavery, and plainly says, &lsquo;I love my
master; I will not go out free.&rsquo;&nbsp; How many are there
even amongst ourselves thus indifferent to liberty!&nbsp; They
know there is a deliverer; they have heard it: they have read it:
they believe it.&nbsp; They know their kinsman has paid the
ransom, so that, according to the covenant, they may be
free.&nbsp; But they love the old sins, and the old ways, and the
old habits, and they have no wish to be set free.&nbsp; They like
the old associations, and a change of heart might cause a
separation from their wives and their children, so they had
rather go on as they are, the slaves <a name="page51"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 51</span>of sin, the bondsmen of their own
corruption.&nbsp; Is it unjust that such persons should never be
set free?&nbsp; If the bondsman of old deliberately went to the
door-post that his ear should be bored, was it unjust that he
should be bound a slave for ever? and if any one of us with the
grand offer of the freedom of the Gospel fully before him,
prefers his bondage and will not accept the purchased freedom, is
it unjust that that man should remain a miserable slave?&nbsp;
Oh, that I could persuade those who have thus far been sitting
still content with their captivity, to accept the freedom which
their kinsman now offers them, so that henceforth we may change
our note, and instead of saying, &lsquo;The ransom is paid, come
home and enjoy your freedom,&rsquo; we may say to them in the
full enjoyment of their Father&rsquo;s loving home, &lsquo;Stand
fast in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made you
free.&rsquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>V.&nbsp; RUTH.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem it
for myself, lest I mar mine own inheritance; redeem thou my right
to thyself; for I cannot redeem it.&rsquo;&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Ruth</span>, iv. 6.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> has been my sacred privilege to
speak lately more than once on the great subject of redemption as
taught in the Old Testament, and the last time I did so I
directed your attention to the law of redemption, as laid down in
the book of Leviticus.&nbsp; But that law conveys a very
imperfect idea of the redemption by our Lord and Saviour.&nbsp;
In some respects there is a remarkable agreement, but the type
falls utterly short of the reality.&nbsp; Let me mention a single
instance.&nbsp; If the kinsman came forward to redeem either the
person or property of the debtor, the effect of that redemption
was to restore the ruined man to his liberty and his home.&nbsp;
The forfeited property was restored, and <a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>the bondman
became free; but there it stopped.&nbsp; The poor man was no
better off after redemption than he was before he was sold.&nbsp;
All that redemption did for him was to restore him to his
original position.&nbsp; Here, then, you see in a moment the
enormous difference between this Levitical redemption and the
blessed work of our most blessed Saviour.&nbsp; He raises man by
redemption to a position far above his position before the
fall.&nbsp; Adam in Paradise had nothing to compare with the
sacred inheritance of the saints of God in the kingdom of our
Lord.&nbsp; Man, as represented in Adam, was far below the
angels; but as redeemed in Christ Jesus, the second Adam, is high
above them.&nbsp; Man in Adam had his inheritance on earth, but
redeemed man in Christ Jesus is made heir to an
&lsquo;inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth
not away, reserved in heaven for him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This point is very well illustrated by the case of Ruth.&nbsp;
The history of Ruth is not unlike that of Joseph&mdash;a
remarkable illustration, though never declared to be a
type.&nbsp; We may, therefore, accept the illustration, though we
must not ascribe to it a divine, or typical, authority.</p>
<p>Turning to chapter i., we find that Elimelech, <a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>a man of
Bethlehem, had property in Bethlehem-judah, and in consequence of
famine and subsequent poverty, had emigrated with his wife and
two sons to Moab.&nbsp; When there, both his sons married, but
before there was any family born to either of them, both they and
their father died.&nbsp; The three women, therefore, were left
widows, and the famine having abated, Naomi decided to
return.&nbsp; She appears to have gone back to the old home at
Bethlehem, but said that her name should be no more Naomi
(pleasant), but Marah (bitter), for the old house had lost its
joy.&nbsp; After her return she struggled on, with Ruth as her
companion.&nbsp; At length Boaz, the great man of the
neighbourhood, &lsquo;a mighty man of wealth,&rsquo; became
acquainted with their circumstances, and most kindly interested
himself in their condition.&nbsp; Being related to Elimelech, he
was prepared to step in, and act the part of a kinsman, by
redeeming the property from sale.&nbsp; But in this there was a
difficulty, for he was not the next of kin, and therefore had no
right to redeem (ch. iii. 12).&nbsp; But when he who was next of
kin heard of it, he declined to act, as he could not undertake
the burden.&nbsp; Boaz, therefore, undertook to pay the
redemption <a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>price himself.&nbsp; Is there not a remarkable
illustration there of the sacred work of our Kinsman, for when
all others failed, though bound by no responsibility, He freely
undertook to redeem us Himself?&nbsp; Thus the price was paid,
the property was redeemed, the family inheritance was preserved,
and it is not at all improbable that it was in that very farm
that Jesse lived, and David spent his boyhood.</p>
<p>But I do not want to dwell on the property, but rather to draw
your attention to the case of Ruth.&nbsp; It was the stipulation
of the covenant that Boaz should redeem all that belonged to
Elimelech and his sons, and therefore he was to receive with the
property the widow of the deceased Mahlon.&nbsp; It was a strange
law that gave him such a power, or rather imposed on him such a
duty.&nbsp; The gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ has raised the
marriage-tie to a sacred position, which would render any such
regulation quite impossible now.&nbsp; But it was the law in the
time of Boaz, and he acted on it when he redeemed the land.</p>
<p>But now I want you to observe carefully the result.</p>
<p>If the famine had not reduced Elimelech <a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>to poverty,
and so compelled him to emigrate to Moab, he and his sons would
have remained in humble life on their property at Bethlehem, and
as for Ruth she would have dwelt unknown in the mountains of
Moab.&nbsp; The famine, therefore, was the first link in the
chain.&nbsp; God&rsquo;s links are often very different to
man&rsquo;s plans.&nbsp; But after Naomi&rsquo;s return, it is
clear that she and her daughter led a struggling life, and were
reduced so low that their property was advertised for sale.&nbsp;
If all had gone well with them, they would apparently have been
just able to live, and as it was, they were very glad of kind and
generous help.&nbsp; But now observe the effect of redemption,
and see how it raised Ruth above the position which either she
herself, or the family of Elimelech, had occupied before the time
of their distress.</p>
<p>There are two things to be noticed.</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; She became the bride of the man who had redeemed
her.&nbsp; Before the redemption he was kind to her, and gave her
six measures of barley into her veil.&nbsp; But by virtue of the
redemption he made her his own, received her to a share of all he
had, and bound himself to her by the sacred tie of a life-long
affection.&nbsp; Now have we <a name="page57"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 57</span>not here a remarkable illustration of
the blessed truth that by redemption we are raised to a position
incomparably higher than that from which man originally
fell?&nbsp; The Church of God is not like the young gleaner
receiving a few shekels of barley as a generous gift; but by
redeeming blood it is raised into the position of the Bride of
the Lamb, and made to sit together in heavenly places in Christ
Jesus.&nbsp; Look at the description of this union as the result
of redemption in Eph. v. 25: &lsquo;Christ also loved the Church,
and gave himself for it, that he might sanctify and cleanse it
with the washing of water by the word, that he might present it
to himself a glorious Church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any
such thing; but that it should be holy and without
blemish.&rsquo;&nbsp; If, therefore, we have redemption through
His blood, we are not merely permitted to glean behind His
reapers, but we are brought into a relationship the most sacred
and intimate that it is possible for the human heart to
imagine.&nbsp; We live in His presence, we are made partakers of
His kingdom, we may rest in His love.&nbsp; His promise is,
&lsquo;As the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, so shall thy
God rejoice <a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>over thee.&rsquo;&nbsp; And even when we are most deeply
and painfully humbled at our own shortcomings, and at the sad
coldness of our own hearts, we may think of Him not only loving
us, but rejoicing in His love, admitting us to the most sacred
confidence, and permitting us with the holy intimacy of a
reverent affection to pour out our whole heart before Him.&nbsp;
If, then, it were an elevation to Ruth to become the bride of the
&lsquo;mighty man of wealth,&rsquo; oh, what an honour is it for
such as we are to be clothed with the white robe of His spotless
righteousness, to be called by His grace into fellowship with
Himself, to be loved by Him with an everlasting love; and,
finally, presented to Him in spotless holiness to be one with Him
for ever!&nbsp; How infinitely higher this is than anything
enjoyed by Adam before the fall!</p>
<p>(2.) But this was not all, for by the act of redemption Ruth
was brought into a special relationship with the Lord Jesus
Christ Himself.&nbsp; In the genealogy of our blessed Saviour
there are only three women mentioned, one of whom was Ruth.&nbsp;
I have no doubt in my own mind that this narrative was written,
and preserved in the canon of Scripture, to prepare the way for
<a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>that
mention of Ruth in the genealogy; for I believe that the great
object of the Old Testament is to trace the sacred line that
terminated in the birth of the promised seed.&nbsp; The whole
history follows that line, and all collateral branches are passed
by without any special record.&nbsp; By the act of redemption,
Ruth was bought into that sacred or royal line: she became the
one woman of her generation that was lineally connected with the
Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp; Jesse, the father of David, was her
grandson, and the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of David, was her
seed.&nbsp; She was therefore brought by the act of redemption
into union with Him, and so are we.&nbsp; Of course there is a
vast difference between the two forms of union.&nbsp; She was the
mother, we the children.&nbsp; He drew His human life from her,
we receive our divine life from Him.&nbsp; In her case it was the
tie of parentage or motherhood; in ours that of sonship.&nbsp; He
was the promised Seed in which all nations of the earth are
blessed; and as such He was her seed, and our Saviour.&nbsp; But
though there was this marked distinction, in both cases
redemption led to union; and if it were an honour to Ruth to be
in the chosen line from which He sprang, is <a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>it not indeed
an honour to such as we are to be admitted amongst the chosen
family who are blessed in Him?&nbsp; Remember the words of the
Apostle connecting sonship with redemption, Gal. iv. 4:
&lsquo;When the fulness of time was come, God sent forth His Son,
made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were
under the law, that we might receive the adoption of
sons.&rsquo;&nbsp; The effect of redemption therefore is so to
identify us with the Son of God that we ourselves in Him become
sons.&nbsp; We are redeemed from the curse and made one with the
Son of God, so that we may go in before the God of glory, and
there cry Abba, Father.&nbsp; Ye then, who have redemption
through His blood, accept your position, and be not afraid of
claiming your union.&nbsp; As Ruth was brought into the same line
of parentage, so are you into that of sonship.&nbsp; Act,
therefore, as sons.&nbsp; Speak to your Father as your
Father.&nbsp; Abide in Him: walk in Him: live in Him: trust in
Him: undertake nothing independently of Him; and God grant that
you may be preserved in Him till the great presentation day, when
in Him you will be presented spotless before His throne!</p>
<p>But we have not yet done with Ruth.&nbsp; You <a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>see clearly
that just as we are raised by redemption to a condition
infinitely higher than that of Adam before the fall, so Ruth was
raised by redemption to a position incomparably higher than that
of Elimelech&rsquo;s family before the famine.&nbsp; But we must
look at her own previous condition, for it was far below the
original condition even of Elimelech.&nbsp; He was one of the
seed of Abraham, a member of the covenant, a proprietor in the
promised land.&nbsp; But she was a poor heathen girl on the
mountains of Moab, an alien from the commonwealth of Israel and a
stranger from the covenant of promise.&nbsp; Yet that poor
heathen girl was raised by redemption to a higher position than
all the Jewesses in the whole family of Elimelech.&nbsp; Does it
not teach us the power of redemption to break down every barrier,
to overturn every human calculation, to clear away every
hindrance, and to raise to the most glorious salvation those very
persons whose case to man&rsquo;s eye seems hopeless?&nbsp;
Doubtless there were noble women in Bethlehem who would have been
glad enough to have been brought into the sacred line of the
motherhood of the Coming One.&nbsp; But the honour was given
through redemption to the poor young widow from Moab.&nbsp; <a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>So there may
be many Englishmen, familiar with the words of the covenant, and
living, as it were, within religious boundaries, but still
strangers to real fellowship with God; while others, far away in
heathen lands, in India, in Africa, in China, are brought in
through the power of redeeming blood, and made heirs of God, and
joint heirs with Christ.&nbsp; So, again, there may be many
amongst us at home who seem as far off as that young woman was
when she was growing up an idolater in Moab; but the lesson that
we are to learn is that there is such a fulness in redemption,
such a power, such a completeness, such an efficacy that that
far-distant sinner, even though he has been an idolater; though
he can never forgive himself, may be forgiven by God; and not
forgiven only, but raised by infinite grace even to a oneness
with the Son of God.&nbsp; Let no one, therefore, feel hopeless,
whatever his position, and whatever his past idolatry; for
redeeming blood can triumph over everything, and can so blot out
all sin that those who are the farthest off of any amongst us may
yet be made nigh by the blood of Christ, and finally presented
spotless before His throne.</p>
<p>But one word more about Ruth, for if we <a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>really desire
thus to be made nigh, her words to Naomi may serve to illustrate
the spirit in which we must come to the Lord Jesus.&nbsp; If we
were to call this a type such an application of them would lead
to nothing but confusion.&nbsp; But looking at it simply as a
piece of history they may suggest a most important
illustration.&nbsp; She said to Naomi, &lsquo;Whither thou goest,
I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall
be my people, and thy God my God.&rsquo;&nbsp; If you desire to
be made to sit in heavenly places in Christ Jesus kneel down, and
from the bottom of your heart say the same to Him.&nbsp; You may
be still far away from God, a stranger in a strange land.&nbsp;
But there is He, having come amongst us to fetch you home, to
seek you, to save you, to raise you to Himself.&nbsp; Let there
be then the loving surrender of your whole soul into His hand;
and let the prayer of your inmost heart be, &lsquo;Whither thou
goest, I will go; thy people shall be my people, and thy God my
God.&rsquo;</p>

<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Into thine hand I commit my spirit; thou
hast redeemed me, O Lord God of truth.&rsquo;&mdash;Ps. xxxi.
5.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is a very happy thing for the
Church of God that David&rsquo;s life was chequered by trials,
and his character by no means free from fault.&nbsp; If he had
never been in difficulty, we should never have been taught how
difficulty drove him to his God; and if he had been a man without
sin, we should not have had from him any lessons on repentance as
we now have in his penitential psalms.&nbsp; To his difficulties
we are indebted for the 31st psalm, and to his sins for the
51st.&nbsp; For this 31st psalm, &lsquo;Trust in
difficulty&rsquo; would be a suitable heading.&nbsp; It opens
with the words, &lsquo;In thee, O Lord, do I put my trust;&rsquo;
and after referring to many sources of anxiety, it concludes with
that noble appeal to all believers, &lsquo;Be of good courage,
and he shall strengthen your heart, all ye that hope in the
Lord.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>But I
am not about to attempt any examination of the whole psalm, but
simply to draw your attention to this one sacred verse, and to
the spirit of confiding trust expressed in it.&nbsp; In the study
of it we will examine, first, the trust, then the redemption
which was the foundation of it.&nbsp; May God teach us so to
realise the plenteous fulness of that redemption that we may be
always able in confiding faith to exercise the trust!</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I.&nbsp; The trust</p>
<p>This is expressed in the words, &lsquo;Into thy hand I commit
my spirit.&rsquo;&nbsp; There are few words in the whole word of
God, presented to us with more sacred authority than these, for
they were quoted by our Lord Himself even on the cross, and were
almost the last words uttered by Him before His death.&nbsp; We
must therefore approach them with a hallowed sense of profound
reverence, and remember that the place whereon we stand is holy
ground.</p>
<p>That use of them by our Blessed Saviour shows that they
express the confiding trust of a dying believer, that the trust
is a death-bed trust, and one especially prepared for that <a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>solemn moment
when we come to the threshold of eternity, and, leaving all
below, are just on the point of entering alone into the unseen
world.&nbsp; Let no one think lightly of such a moment, or
suppose that because there may be perfect peace there is no deep
solemnity in the approaching change.&nbsp; There is an
inexpressible solemnity about it, and it is only the foolhardy
man that will ever brave it unprepared.&nbsp; But the words of
this text are exactly suited to the well-prepared believer.&nbsp;
He has reached the point when friends can do no more for
him.&nbsp; The faithful wife can accompany him no further; the
loving child can no longer minister to his comfort; every human
help utterly fails; and the dying man is left alone with
God.&nbsp; But his Blessed Father is at his right hand, and can
reach his soul even when men think he is unconscious; so that,
even at that moment when to the eye of man there is nothing but
weakness, confusion, and failure, the trusting heart, in the
inner secrets of the soul, can lean on the Beloved, and say,
&lsquo;Into thine hand I commit my spirit: thou hast redeemed me,
O Lord God of truth.&rsquo;&nbsp; This is what our Lord did just
as he was dying; this is what Stephen did when he <a
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>said,
&lsquo;Lord Jesus, receive my spirit;&rsquo; and this is what I
hope each of us may be able to do when the time of our departure
is come, and the curtain which separates earth from heaven is
being drawn aside to let us pass.</p>
<p>But I do not think that death is the only occasion on which we
may use these words, or that we are to lay them by unused till we
require them in our dying hour; for, as far as we can gather from
the psalm, they are to have a present life-use likewise.&nbsp;
The psalm is not a death-bed psalm, but one composed under
difficulties.&nbsp; Nor did David write it under any expectation
that he would be overpowered by these difficulties, for in verses
2, 3, and 4, he prays for deliverance; and in verse 8 he
expressly declares, &lsquo;Thou hast not shut me up into the hand
of the enemy: thou hast set my feet in a large room.&rsquo;&nbsp;
We must, therefore, regard these words as spoken by one who was
in difficulty, and being in difficulty, availed himself of the
privilege of committing all his difficulties into his
Father&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; But you will observe that in this
verse he does not speak so much of his difficulties as his
spirit.&nbsp; He does not say, &lsquo;Into thy hand I commend my
difficulties,&rsquo; but <a name="page68"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 68</span>&lsquo;Into thy hand I commend my
spirit.&rsquo;&nbsp; He may in those words have prayed for the
preservation of his life, but I think it was rather the
preservation of his own spirit, what St. Paul describes
&lsquo;the spirit of the mind,&rsquo; for which he required
help.&nbsp; We all know how the spirit is harassed, and the rest
of the soul disturbed, when we are placed in circumstances of
perplexity.&nbsp; At such times we are often distracted in
prayer, and are so much occupied by the things that trouble us
that we are tempted to forget our resting-place.&nbsp; Hence the
importance of especial prayer, not merely that difficulties may
be overcome, but that our own spirit may be kept unruffled and
undisturbed in perfect peace reposing on the Lord.&nbsp; This is
just what David did in the psalm.&nbsp; He earnestly prayed that
he might be delivered.&nbsp; &lsquo;Deliver me in thy
righteousness.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Deliver me
speedily.&rsquo;&nbsp; He earnestly sought God&rsquo;s guiding
hand, in order that in his own conduct he might do God&rsquo;s
will: &lsquo;For thy name&rsquo;s sake lead me and guide
me.&rsquo;&nbsp; And meanwhile he trusted his own spirit, his
mind, his thoughts, his temper, his whole man into his
Father&rsquo;s keeping, and said, &lsquo;Into thy hand I commit
my spirit.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>II.&nbsp; But now let us turn to that redemption which
was the foundation of his trust.&nbsp; He did not trust without a
reason, but said, &lsquo;Into thy hand I commit my spirit; thou
hast redeemed me, O Lord God of truth;&rsquo; and we have to
consider what he meant by that expression, &lsquo;Thou hast
redeemed me.&rsquo;&nbsp; In answer to this question, I have no
hesitation in expressing my firm conviction that the redemption
to which he referred was precisely the same as that on which we
ourselves rest, the redemption from the guilt of sin wrought out
by the Lord Jesus on the cross.&nbsp; There has never been any
other redemption which could be the foundation of trust either in
life or in death; and when we find the blessing of the Gospel
connected in the Old Testament with redemption, we have no choice
but to believe that the redemption with which they are connected
is that great redemption by the Lord Jesus on which all our own
hopes exclusively depend.&nbsp; Take, for example, such words as
those of David, in Ps. cxxx.&nbsp; The great subject of that
psalm is forgiveness: &lsquo;There is forgiveness with thee, that
thou mayest be feared&rsquo; (ver. 4); and the reason why Israel
is to hope for it is that &lsquo;with the Lord <a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>there is
mercy, and with him is plenteous redemption.&rsquo;&nbsp; What
but the redemption through the precious blood of the Lord Jesus
can be described as thus plenteous for all who need
forgiveness?&nbsp; The same may be said of those words of God
Himself in Isa. xliv. 22: &lsquo;I have blotted out, as a thick
cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins: return unto
me, for I have redeemed thee.&rsquo;&nbsp; He cannot refer in
those words to any deliverance that had already taken place, for
he is only inviting the sinner to return; but he clearly refers
to the blotting out of the curse through atoning blood, and to
the way of life laid open to the returning sinner.&nbsp; So I
cannot doubt for a moment that redemption in this verse means
exactly the same as in both those passages.&nbsp; In Isaiah God
said, &lsquo;I have redeemed thee;&rsquo; and in this verse David
said, &lsquo;Thou hast redeemed me.&rsquo;&nbsp; The one gives,
the other accepts; but they both speak of the same thing, the
redemption on the cross, the only satisfaction for sin.&nbsp;
Thus our blessed Lord, when He quoted the words, omitted this
latter clause.&nbsp; He said, &lsquo;Into thine hands I commit my
spirit;&rsquo; but he did not say, &lsquo;For thou hast redeemed
me.&rsquo;&nbsp; The reason of this is <a name="page71"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 71</span>obvious, for God had not redeemed
Him, and He Himself was at that very time engaged in completing
the redemption by His death.&nbsp; He could not use the words,
for they referred to that great act of mercy in which at that
very time He was engaged.</p>
<p>But it may be said, If the redemption here spoken of was not
to take place for more than a thousand years after the psalm was
written, how was it that David spoke of it as a completed
thing?&nbsp; Why did he not rather say, &lsquo;Thou art about to
redeem me?&rsquo;&nbsp; In answer to that question, two reasons
may be given, either of which would be quite sufficient to
explain his words.</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; The redemption was already complete in the eternal
purpose of God.&nbsp; Remember those words by St. Peter (1 Pet i.
19, 20): &lsquo;Ye were redeemed with the precious blood of
Christ . . . who verily was fore-ordained before the foundation
of the world, but was manifest in these last times for
you;&rsquo; and remember how he is described (Rev. xiii. 8) as
&lsquo;the Lamb slain from the foundation of the
world.&rsquo;&nbsp; Although, therefore, the Son of God has not
yet become incarnate, God speaking of His divine purpose <a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>could say,
&lsquo;I have redeemed thee;&rsquo; and His believing servant,
referring to that same purpose, could reply, though a thousand
years must pass before he witnessed it, &lsquo;Thou hast redeemed
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; But it was not purposed only, for it was
promised.&nbsp; It was promised to our first parents the very day
of their miserable fall, and it was kept continually before the
eye of God&rsquo;s people by a series of types and
prophecies.&nbsp; Thus David&rsquo;s language is an illustration
of the words, &lsquo;Faith is the substance of things hoped
for.&rsquo;&nbsp; What God had promised was as sure to him as if
he held it in his hand; it was as much his own as if he had seen
it.&nbsp; He was as sure of the power of the cross of Christ, as
if he had been standing by, and had heard the centurion say,
&lsquo;Verily this was the Son of God.&rsquo;&nbsp; And is it not
apparent from the verse itself that this is the real meaning of
his words? for what is the peculiar force of those concluding
words &lsquo;O Lord God of truth?&rsquo;&nbsp; Do they not teach
us that he was assured of that redemption, not because it had
seen it accomplished, but because it was made sure by the truth
of God?&nbsp; The truth of God was pledged to the redeeming work
<a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>and
therefore that work was as sure to him as if it were already
finished.&nbsp; He did not, therefore, wait to puzzle his mind
about times and seasons; he knew that God was true to His
promise, and therefore being assured of His declared purpose, he
said, &lsquo;Thou hast redeemed me, O Lord God of
truth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But if this be the case, we are surely brought to the
conclusion that, whatever be our position, redeeming grace must
be the one foundation of believing trust.&nbsp; Patriarchal faith
looking forward, and modern Christian faith looking backward,
both meet in one point, that point being the cross of
Christ.&nbsp; And as for ourselves it matters not what are our
peculiar circumstances.&nbsp; We may be actively engaged in the
work of life, involved in its perplexities, and compelled to take
a part in its struggles; or we may be at the end of life,
expecting in a day or two to depart hence, and be no more: but in
either case we must rest simply on the atoning blood, and resting
on it, whether it be for life or for death, we may say in calm,
quiet, peaceful, trusting faith, &lsquo;Into thy hand I commit my
spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O Lord God of truth.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>But
while we trust the perfect work we must not forget the perfect
truth, for we are quite as dependent on that truth as David
was.&nbsp; To his mind that had turned a future act into a
present reality, and on that same truth we rely in order that the
same act, long since completed, may be to us a present salvation,
and the assurance of it a present power.&nbsp; We want each one
to look back to the cross as David looked forward to it, and to
say in happy, peaceful, personal trust as he did, &lsquo;Into
thine hand I commit my spirit, for thou hast redeemed
me.&rsquo;&nbsp; But in order to do this we must not forget the
truth.&nbsp; We cannot rest on the work without the word any
better than on the word without the work.&nbsp; It is when both
are combined, and both applied by the Holy Ghost to the soul,
that we can say, &lsquo;Thy counsels of old are faithfulness and
truth,&rsquo; and resting on those eternal counsels, whether
living or dying, may trust Him without a fear.</p>
<p>May we not then, every one of us, learn a lesson of simple
trust from these few words in David&rsquo;s psalm?&nbsp; It
matters not what is our position.&nbsp; When we are dying men and
drawing near to the gateway of eternity we may calmly look up,
and trust our soul for all eternity into <a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>His
hand.&nbsp; If we be exposed to harassing anxiety, and are
anxious about our own temper and judgment in difficult
circumstances, we may spread our own spirit in simple faith
before the throne.&nbsp; Or if we are undertaking work, and
endeavouring to be employed for God, feeling the need of wisdom,
zeal, love, and power, we may commit it all into His loving
care.&nbsp; Yes, whatever it is that weighs on our mind, death,
anxiety, disappointment, or duty, we may trust it all, and,
whatever it is, may say as St. Paul did, &lsquo;I am persuaded
that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him
against that day.&rsquo;&nbsp; Yes; and He is perfectly sure to
keep it safe.</p>
<p>But there is one little word in the text that I have not
noticed, and yet it is an essential one to the trust.&nbsp; Great
principles are often found in little words, and so it is here,
for all hangs on that little monosyllable &lsquo;me.&rsquo;&nbsp;
If you can only say, &lsquo;Thou hast redeemed mankind,&rsquo;
your soul will never rest in abiding trust.&nbsp; Nor will it if
you can only say, &lsquo;Thou hast redeemed thy Church,&rsquo;
for the safety of the Church does not secure the peace of the
individual.&nbsp; It is only when you can reverently look up to
the atoning blood, and say, &lsquo;Thou hast redeemed
<i>me</i>,&rsquo; that <a name="page76"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 76</span>you will be able in hallowed peace to
commit everything into His loving hand.&nbsp; When you can say
with deep thanksgiving, &lsquo;In whom <i>I</i> have redemption
through his blood,&rsquo; you may then without the shadow of a
doubt commit your body, your soul, your spirit, your will, your
thoughts, your work, and all you care for, into His loving
hand.</p>

77</span>VII.&nbsp; ANATHOTH.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Behold, Hanameel the son of Shallum thine
uncle shall come unto thee, saying, Buy thee my field that is in
Anathoth: for the right of redemption is thine to buy
it.&rsquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Jer</span>. xxxii. 7.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Old and New Testaments are so
linked together that they cannot well be separated.&nbsp; The Old
is the foundation of the New; the New is the head-stone of the
Old; and the same great principles run through them both.&nbsp;
Thus faith in the Old Testament is the same in principle as faith
in the New; and by studying the faith of the ancient patriarchs
and prophets we may learn most important lessons respecting that
of the modern believer.&nbsp; In different ages and different
persons faith may differ in its object and in its form; but it is
always the same in principle, and always involves the fixed
assurance that what God has promised He is able and certain to
perform.&nbsp; This is very clearly <a name="page78"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 78</span>seen in the deeply important lesson
of practical faith conveyed to us in this history of
Jeremiah.&nbsp; The events described in the chapter took place
during the siege of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar.&nbsp; Zedekiah
was then king, and was struggling to the utmost of his power
against the powerful enemy that was come up against him.&nbsp; In
the midst of the siege the Prophet Jeremiah was employed to
convey a most discouraging prophecy, for, as you read verse 3,
Jeremiah said, &lsquo;Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will give
this city unto the hands of the king of Babylon, and he shall
take it.&rsquo;&nbsp; Of course such a prophecy was calculated to
dishearten the defenders of the city.&nbsp; So, though it was the
word of the Lord, Zedekiah arrested the prophet and shut him up
in the court of the prison.&nbsp; Jeremiah, therefore, was in a
position of great distress, the city was besieged, and he knew
from his own prophecy that it would be taken; while he himself
was a prisoner at the mercy of a bad and arbitrary king.</p>
<p>But while he was there alone in his prison the word of the
Lord came to him saying that his first cousin, by name Hanameel,
would come unto him and say, &lsquo;Buy thee my field that is in
<a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>Anathoth:
for the right of redemption is thine to buy it.&rsquo;&nbsp; You
will remember that we found the nearest of kin had the right of
redemption, and evidently Jeremiah stood in that position to his
cousin.&nbsp; As famine and pestilence were raging in the city
(see ver. 24), it is easy to understand why Hanameel was
compelled to sell.&nbsp; But he could not sell to any one, for
the right of redemption belonged to Jeremiah.&nbsp; The prophet,
therefore, was warned by the Lord that Hanameel was coming to him
with this object; and accordingly he very soon appeared as was
foretold, and said, &lsquo;Buy my field I pray thee that is in
Anathoth, which is in the country of Benjamin: for the right of
redemption is thine; buy it for thyself,&rsquo; ver. 8.&nbsp; You
must not fail to notice the confirmation of his faith through
this fulfilment of the prophecy, for when Hanameel came to him he
said, &lsquo;Then knew I that this was the word of the
Lord.&rsquo;&nbsp; Till then he was probably not quite satisfied,
but when his cousin came as it had been foretold, then he knew it
was of God.&nbsp; Let us learn a lesson for ourselves.&nbsp;
There were many prophecies of a coming Saviour scattered
throughout the four thousand years that preceded His birth, and I
can perfectly <a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>understand the difficulty of faith in those who did not
see those prophecies realised; but now that the Promised One has
come according to His promise, and the great prediction has been
fulfilled, the least that we can say is, &lsquo;Now we know that
this was the word of the Lord.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But to return to Jeremiah.&nbsp; Being convinced that the
whole thing was of God, he proceeded at once to redeem the
field.&nbsp; He took care that the deeds were properly drawn,
signed, sealed, and witnessed.&nbsp; And when the money,
seventeen shekels of silver, was paid, and the conveyance
complete, he trusted the deeds to Baruch, his faithful friend,
and charged him to deposit them safely in an earthen
vessel.&nbsp; His words were, &lsquo;Take these evidences, this
evidence of the purchase, both which is sealed, and this evidence
which is open, and put them in an earthen vessel that they may
continue many days.&rsquo;&nbsp; You will observe that last
clause, &lsquo;that they may continue many days.&rsquo;&nbsp; He
seemed quite sure that it would be a long time before they would
be wanted.</p>
<p>Thus the transaction was complete, and the land redeemed; but
not so Jeremiah&rsquo;s part respecting it, for when he had
delivered the evidence <a name="page81"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 81</span>of purchase unto Baruch, his next act
was to kneel down in prayer.&nbsp; He says, ver. 16, &lsquo;I
prayed unto the Lord.&rsquo;&nbsp; I have not time now to study
either his prayer or God&rsquo;s answer to it; I would only
remark in passing what a blessed thing it is when all that we do
is of such a character that we can pray about it before
God.&nbsp; It would wonderfully alter the character of commercial
life if every bargain could be spread in prayer before God, and
if every contract were of such a nature that as soon as it was
complete we could kneel down and ask God&rsquo;s blessing on
it.&nbsp; I am inclined to think that this principle would knock
off a great many of the hard bargains made in life.&nbsp; It
would certainly prevent all cases of fraud and adulteration, and
put a stop at once to the whole principle of the non-payment of
lawful debts.&nbsp; Jeremiah, when he would redeem the land,
first paid the money, and then knelt down to pray.</p>
<p>But that is not the point to be particularly noticed in the
passage, for we must rather study the mind of Jeremiah, and
consider on what principle he redeemed the field.&nbsp; Why was
it that, when he knew the city was about to be taken, and
everything within it was already at <a name="page82"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 82</span>famine prices, he apparently threw
away these seventeen shekels in the purchase of a field which to
all appearance he was never likely to possess?&nbsp; He knew
perfectly well that at the time he purchased it it could be of no
use whatever.&nbsp; It is believed to have been about three miles
north of Jerusalem, and was probably at that very time trampled
down by the besieging host, and he knew equally well that till
after the restoration of the Jews he was not likely to attain
possession.&nbsp; The city was invested by the Chaldeans, and
there was not the smallest hope of a successful resistance; why
then at such a time should he spend money in the redemption of
the field?&nbsp; I believe that there were three principles on
which he acted,&mdash;obedience, faith, and confidence in the law
of redemption, and that he was called to do what he did in order
to teach these principles to his besieged fellow-countrymen.</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; There was clearly obedience, simple obedience in
direct opposition to human calculation.&nbsp; You may see this
very clearly in the concluding words of his prayer.&nbsp; It is
clear from ver. 24 that all human calculation was against him,
and he knew it to be so, for he said, &lsquo;Behold the mounts,
they are come unto the city to take it; and the <a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>city is given
into the hand of the Chaldeans that fight against it, because of
the sword, and of the famine, and of the pestilence; and what
thou hast spoken is come to pass; and, behold, thou seest
it.&rsquo;&nbsp; But the Lord had commanded him to buy the field,
for he adds, ver. 25, &lsquo;And thou hast said unto me, O Lord
God, Buy thee the field for money, and take witnesses: for&rsquo;
(or rather &lsquo;though,&rsquo; according to the margin)
&lsquo;the city is given into the hands of the
Chaldeans.&rsquo;&nbsp; God told him to buy it, <i>though</i> the
city was given up to the Chaldeans.&nbsp; He was not, therefore,
to be guided by what he saw, but by what he knew to be the will
of God.&nbsp; If he were to lose all his money, and never come
into possession of the field, it was his clear duty to
obey.&nbsp; And so it is ours, when once we are convinced of the
will of God.</p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; But as believers in the Lord Jesus we are not
called to obey without hope, for where there is no hope you will
never find power.&nbsp; The Christian&rsquo;s obedience,
therefore, is full of hope, because it is all founded on faith,
and so was the obedience of Jeremiah.&nbsp; He acted in faith,
firmly trusting the promises of God.&nbsp; You see this very
clearly in his words to Baruch when he handed <a
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>him the
deeds, as recorded ver. 15: &lsquo;For thus saith the Lord of
hosts, the God of Israel, Houses and fields and vineyards shall
be possessed again in this land.&rsquo;&nbsp; He looked,
therefore, beyond the present distress, and, more than that,
beyond what I may term the first future.&nbsp; He foresaw the
overthrow, but he looked beyond it to the recovery.&nbsp; He
himself predicted desolation, but he was so sure of the
restoration that on the strength of that assurance he redeemed
the land.&nbsp; Though he saw the army of the Chaldeans around
the city, though he was at that very time in prison for
prophesying, &lsquo;Thus saith the Lord, Behold I will give this
city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take
it,&rsquo; yet he was so sure of the truth of God&rsquo;s promise
to restore it, that he acted on the promise, and purchased the
property.&nbsp; He looked beyond the captivity to the recovery,
and confidently acted on God&rsquo;s promise.&nbsp; That he fully
realised the difficulty is clear from the words of his prayer, in
which he said, ver. 17, &lsquo;There is nothing too hard for
thee,&rsquo; and from God&rsquo;s reply to these words in ver.
27, &lsquo;Is there anything too hard for me?&rsquo;&nbsp; But he
was, like Abraham, fully persuaded that what God had promised
&lsquo;He was able also to <a name="page85"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 85</span>perform,&rsquo; and therefore he
acted on the promise? and paid down his money in the certainty
that God would fulfil His word.&nbsp; Dear brethren, is there not
a noble lesson here for all of us?&nbsp; Are we not all taught,
not merely to believe, but to act on our belief?&nbsp; We may see
difficulties thickening around us; we may even see prophecies of
sore trial in the latter days.&nbsp; But we know that our God
shall trample down Satan under our feet shortly.&nbsp; We are to
trust Him, therefore, and act on our trust.&nbsp; We see things
decaying around us; we look at our own frail bodies, and believe
that they will soon be laid lifeless in the grave.&nbsp; We see
death cutting down our dearest friends, and we know that, if the
Lord does not come first, it will soon cut us down too.&nbsp; But
we look beyond to a resurrection, to the certain promise that we
shall rise again; and therefore now we must live and act as those
who are sure of the resurrection life.&nbsp; To adopt the figure
of the narrative, we must purchase the field with a view to the
restoration.&nbsp; There may be dark days and sore trials before
the time of possession; but it is certain to come at last.&nbsp;
As Daniel said, &lsquo;The thing is true though the time
appointed is long.&rsquo;&nbsp; So we know the premise is <a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>true, though
the time of waiting may be long; and we must spend our whole
life, and lay out all our powers, with the one fixed object of a
certainty of possession when the dead shall arise, and the Lord
shall take the kingdom.</p>
<p>(3.)&nbsp; But besides faith in the promise of God there was
also confidence in the validity of the act of redemption.&nbsp;
There was no doubt about the soundness of his title.&nbsp; The
whole transaction was according to law.&nbsp; Hanameel had a
legal right to sell, Jeremiah a legal right to redeem, and the
conveyance was legally completed.&nbsp; All was done that was
required by the law of transfer, and when those deeds were
carefully deposited in the earthen vessel, there to continue for
many days, Jeremiah clearly considered that whenever the time of
restoration should come, the deeds would be recognised as valid,
and his title as sufficient.&nbsp; He regarded the act of
redemption as sufficient security whenever God should restore the
land to Israel.&nbsp; And now, dear brethren, have we not all a
magnificent lesson to learn from his example?&nbsp; We are
looking forward to the times of restoration: we expect to rise
again; we fully believe that the Lord Jesus Christ will come
bringing His saints <a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
87</span>with Him, and, like Jeremiah, we depend on the finished
act of redemption, as our own title to a share in the coming
inheritance.&nbsp; Now look at that great act of
redemption.&nbsp; There was no flaw in any part of it, for the
whole law was fulfilled.&nbsp; The full price was paid, for we
may adapt the words of the prophet, &lsquo;She hath received of
the Lord&rsquo;s hand double for all her sins.&rsquo;&nbsp; The
redemption price was not seventeen shekels of silver; but the
most precious blood of the Son of God.&nbsp; The Redeemer is not
a mere man, a prisoner in the dungeon of the king; but the Son of
God already risen from the dead, and already seated at the right
hand of the throne.&nbsp; And the deeds are not deposited in any
earthen vessel, or trusted to the care of such a man as Baruch;
but they are treasured up in heaven itself, kept safe in the
eternal counsels of Jehovah.&nbsp; And now follows the question,
was that redemption by the Son of God sufficient?&nbsp; And are
these title-deeds secure?&nbsp; If Jeremiah could trust to those
sealed documents in the earthen vessel under Baruch&rsquo;s care,
may we not trust to the full satisfaction made through redeeming
blood, and the perfect security of the covenant of God as sealed,
ratified, and preserved <a name="page88"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 88</span>by Jesus Christ Himself?&nbsp; Of
course when persons have no interest in that redemption, when
they have no part in that redeeming work, we cannot then say that
their title is secure, for, poor people! they have neither title
nor inheritance; they have no hope in the restoration as they are
without God in the present.&nbsp; Oh! that I knew how to persuade
such persons never to rest till they have their title-deeds to a
heavenly inheritance.&nbsp; But I am not speaking of them.&nbsp;
I am speaking rather of the redeemed believer, whose &lsquo;life
is hid with Christ in God;&rsquo; and I want to persuade all
parties, both those that do, and those that do not, possess the
title-deeds, to consider well the unspeakable blessedness of
having the title safely deposited with the Son of God, so that,
whatever happens, whatever success or discouragement, whether joy
or trial, whether life or death, we may be perfectly sure that
all is safe, for the redemption has been completed by the Lord
Jesus Christ Himself, and the title-deeds are safe, being laid up
in the treasury of God.</p>

89</span>VIII.&nbsp; THE PIT.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;O Lord, thou hast pleaded the causes of my
soul; thou hast redeemed my life.&rsquo;&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Lam</span>. iii. 58.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We studied in the last lecture the remarkable faith of
Jeremiah.&nbsp; We found how he redeemed the field in Anathoth at
the very time that Jerusalem was invested by the Chaldeans, and
he himself was predicting the certainty of its destruction: but
in that moment of hopelessness he had such entire trust in the
promise of restoration, and such assurance in the validity of the
title, that he purchased the field as readily as he would have
done had everything been at the height of prosperity.&nbsp; We
saw in such conduct the practical acting of faith.&nbsp; But it
is very interesting also to look at the hidden life of faith, and
to know, while he was thus acting, what was secretly passing in
his soul.&nbsp; I think that this passage may throw great light
on the <a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>subject.&nbsp; From ver. 55 it is clear that he referred
to a time when he was in the low dungeon: &lsquo;I called upon
thy name, O Lord, out of the low dungeon.&rsquo;&nbsp; We are not
informed to which imprisonment he referred.&nbsp; It may have
been the imprisonment in the courts of the prison which was in
the court of the king&rsquo;s house, during which he redeemed the
land of Hanameel, or it may have been the much more severe
imprisonment which subsequently followed, as described Jer.
xxxviii. 6, when they let him down by ropes into a deep, damp
pit, called the dungeon of Malchiah.&nbsp; The expression
&lsquo;the low dungeon,&rsquo; seems rather to describe this
latter captivity, and we may picture to ourselves God&rsquo;s
faithful servant left alone in a deep, dark pit, standing up to
his waist in the mire, without a comfort, without a friend, and
without even a fellow-prisoner to share his trouble.&nbsp; His
title-deeds to the field in Anathoth would not do much to help
him there.&nbsp; But he was a man of trust, and afterwards, when
he was still in sore trouble, and deeply grieved at the ruin of
the city, he could look back on that time and say, &lsquo;Thou
hast pleaded the causes of my soul, thou hast redeemed my
life.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>Let us
study then this remarkable record of his intercourse with God
during this time of his deep trouble.&nbsp; There was nothing
done.&nbsp; It was not a time for doing.&nbsp; He could not climb
out, he could only stand and wait.&nbsp; What then was passing in
his soul?&nbsp; What transactions took place between him and
God?&nbsp; To these questions I think this passage supplies an
answer.&nbsp; There are three things that seem perfectly
clear.</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; He called on the name of the Lord.&nbsp; Perhaps he
remembered the words of Psalm xxxiv.: &lsquo;This poor man cried,
and the Lord heard him, and saved him out of all his
troubles.&rsquo;&nbsp; At all events he acted on them, and though
in all probability he could not kneel because of the mire, yet he
could pray, and so he did.&nbsp; But he was not like many people
who live prayerless lives, and only begin to pray when they get
into trouble, for prayer was no new thing to him.&nbsp; He was no
stranger at the throne of grace, and he could look back on many
happy occasions in which he had reason to be quite sure God had
answered him.&nbsp; It is a terrible thing when men go on,
strangers to prayer, till they are driven to it by
calamity.&nbsp; It was not so with Jeremiah.&nbsp; He knew the
mercy-seat well, and he was well <a name="page92"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 92</span>known there.&nbsp; He could refer to
answers in former times, and say, &lsquo;Thou hast heard my
voice,&rsquo; and so appeal to God in his present trouble and
say, &lsquo;Hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my
cry.&rsquo;&nbsp; There was both a breathing and a cry; the cry
being the actual expression of his wants in words, and the
breathing, the outpouring of his soul in mental intercourse with
a God who knew his thoughts.&nbsp; It is well to remember this
distinction between the breathing and the prayer.&nbsp; The
prayer is not altogether unlike the food at stated seasons.&nbsp;
The breathing is the unceasing communion of soul as essential to
life as breath is to the body.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>(2.) And now mark, in the second place, how God treated
him.&nbsp; The King of Kings was not ashamed of being the
companion of the prisoner in the pit.&nbsp; It was a deep, dark
dungeon; but the man of God was not alone there.&nbsp; The stone
on the top could not shut out God, as it could not shut in
prayer.&nbsp; And you will observe the prophet was not required
to climb out of the pit to find the Lord, as so many people are
continually trying to do, but the Lord drew nigh to him when he
was at the bottom, not when he was at the top, or half-way up;
but at the bottom, <a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>in the mire, and in the dark.&nbsp; It was there that
God drew near to him in the day that he called, and most
graciously spoke to his soul, and said, &lsquo;Fear
not.&rsquo;&nbsp; How often, how mercifully have these words been
spoken!&nbsp; I believe they occur more than fifty times in
Scripture.&nbsp; How often do we meet with such words as
&lsquo;Fear not, Abraham.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Fear not, thou worm
Jacob.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Fear not, Daniel.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Fear not, Zacharias.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Fear not, little
flock.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Fear not, Paul.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Fear not, I am the first and the last!&rsquo;&nbsp; Do not
all these passages show that there is reason for fear in outward
life, and that there is the element of fear in the human heart,
but there may be a victory over fear even in the bottom of the
pit, when the Lord Himself draws nigh, and says, &lsquo;Fear
not.&rsquo;&nbsp; But you may say you cannot hear the words, and,
no doubt, in that you are correct, for we are not to expect loud
voices from heaven.&nbsp; We have not the least reason to believe
that Jeremiah heard a voice.&nbsp; When David prayed, &lsquo;Say
unto my soul, I am thy salvation,&rsquo; he did not mean that
these words should be spoken audibly to his ear.&nbsp; But he did
mean that the assurance of God&rsquo;s salvation should be
applied by the Holy Spirit to his heart.&nbsp; And so <a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>when God drew
near to Jeremiah and said, &lsquo;Fear not,&rsquo; we are not to
understand that His person was visible to the eye, or the sound
of His voice perceptible to the ear.&nbsp; But we are to
understand that He so spoke to his heart as to assure him of His
nearness, and to still his fears.&nbsp; And so it is with
us.&nbsp; We do not look for anything perceptible by outward
sense, but we do look for a rest from fear in the heart through
the divine application of the Lord&rsquo;s grace and very present
help to the soul.</p>
<p>(3.)&nbsp; And now consider, thirdly, the practical result in
Jeremiah&rsquo;s attitude of mind.&nbsp; He could look calmly up
to Him who had drawn nigh unto Him, and say, &lsquo;O Lord, thou
hast pleaded the causes of my soul, thou hast redeemed my
life.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is difficult to determine exactly whether
this was his language in the low dungeon, or after he was taken
out of it.&nbsp; We read in Jer. xxxviii., that Ebed-melech, one
of the king&rsquo;s eunuchs, obtained permission to draw him up
out of the dungeon, and he was subsequently confined in the court
of the prison.&nbsp; As I have frequently pointed out, the word
redemption sometimes stands simply for deliverance, and it is
possible that it may do so here, and refer to the deliverance <a
name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>by
Ebed-melech.&nbsp; But I do not think it does, for the latter
part of the chapter seems clearly to teach that when Jeremiah
wrote these words he was not yet delivered, but was still
enduring the bitter hostility of his revengeful enemies.&nbsp; I
am, therefore, rather disposed to regard these words as the
utterance of a trusting heart when he was still in the low
dungeon.&nbsp; I look on them, not as the effect of Ebed-melech
pulling him out, but of God drawing near to him when he was in
it, and saying to his soul, &lsquo;Fear not.&rsquo;&nbsp; I think
the passage is faith&rsquo;s reply to God&rsquo;s address.&nbsp;
God drew near, and said, &lsquo;Fear not,&rsquo; and faith
accepted it at once, though still in the pit, and said,
&lsquo;Thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul, thou hast
redeemed my life.&rsquo;&nbsp; The language seems to lead us far
beyond anything done by Ebed-melech, to a divine redemption, and
a divine pleading of his cause.&nbsp; They remind us of those
other words of Jeremiah, &lsquo;Their Redeemer is strong; the
Lord of hosts is his name; he shall thoroughly plead their
cause;&rsquo; Jer. L. 34; and I cannot help thinking that
Jeremiah looked forward, as David did, to the great redemption by
the Lord Jesus, as purposed from eternity, and promised in the <a
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>sure word of
God.&nbsp; As David said, &lsquo;Thou hast redeemed me;&rsquo; so
he said, &lsquo;Thou hast redeemed my life.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was
the Redeemer Himself that drew near to him in his low estate, and
as it were said unto his soul, &lsquo;I am thy
salvation.&rsquo;&nbsp; The promised work was not yet
accomplished, but it was brought home to his heart, and, though
the stone was still on the mouth of the dungeon, his soul was
free, and his life was safe, for he was redeemed in the coming
Christ.</p>
<p>If this be the meaning of the passage, does it not teach us
that redeeming grace must always be our great help in
trouble?&nbsp; If we are brought to the bottom of the pit, by
sorrow, by sickness, by calamity, by the approach of death, or by
the deep and painful sense of sin, all true source of strength
must ever be in the great work of redemption wrought out for us
by the Son of God.&nbsp; It is that which opens the way to the
throne, and which enables us to rest in the assurance of the love
of God.&nbsp; You may find many difficulties in the way of faith,
and many drawbacks under the profound sense of your own
unworthiness.&nbsp; But it is wonderful to find how they
disappear before the cross of Christ; and if only you are enabled
to say, &lsquo;Thou hast redeemed my life,&rsquo; <a
name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>you will find
in that one fact, a blessed, holy, peaceful resting-place, even
though by outward circumstances or inward trial you may still be
at the bottom of the pit.</p>
<p>But whatever view we take of the expression, &lsquo;Thou hast
redeemed my life,&rsquo; one thing is perfectly clear, that the
redemption was applied to Jeremiah&rsquo;s soul at the bottom of
the pit.&nbsp; If it is to be explained of deliverance it was
when he was sunk into the mire at the bottom of the low dungeon
that the deliverance was applied.&nbsp; And if it describes the
application to his soul of the Lord&rsquo;s redemption, and his
acceptance of it as something already as sure as if it were
perfected, it was when he was bowed down in the very depths of
trouble that the blessed work was brought home with peace to his
soul.&nbsp; Whatever meaning you give to the word
&lsquo;redemption&rsquo; in this passage, redemption was brought
home to him at the bottom of the pit.</p>
<p>Now I cannot imagine a more important principle than this for
all those who really desire to partake of all the blessings of
redemption.&nbsp; Of course there are some who do not trouble
their minds about it, being satisfied with their own religious
respectability; but there are multitudes <a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>deeply
concerned about it.&nbsp; They earnestly desire to be able to
say, &lsquo;Thou hast redeemed my life,&rsquo; but they cannot do
so; and yet possibly they have been really taking pains to do so
for many years, although without the least sign of
progress.&nbsp; Now may not their difficulties arise in many
cases from their having reversed the order of the dealings of
God?&nbsp; They have hoped to climb up partially out of the pit,
and to reach redemption at the top, instead of accepting it as a
free gift of God while they are still helpless at the
bottom.&nbsp; In other words, they are endeavouring first to
remove their difficulties, and then to trust redemption.&nbsp; No
wonder then that they completely fail! for how are they to climb
up out of the pit? and how are they to overcome their
difficulties while they are still at a distance from redeeming
grace?&nbsp; It is redemption that is to deliver, redemption that
is to raise us from the dead, redemption that removes the
difficulty, how then can we ever hope to rise until redemption is
applied and realised?&nbsp; If redemption is not sufficient to
reach down to one in a state of utter hopelessness, it is
insufficient for the conscience-stricken sinner.&nbsp; Remember,
therefore, the case of Jeremiah.&nbsp; <a name="page99"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 99</span>Consider his case as an illustration
of your own, and if you are yourself at the bottom of what I may
term the religious pit, in a low dungeon from which you cannot
rise, remember how the Lord drew near to him when he was at the
bottom, and did not wait till he had climbed even half-way to
reach His hand.&nbsp; Just so it must be with you.&nbsp; He must
stoop to reach you before you can rise to reach Him.&nbsp; Your
first act of faith must be when you are at the bottom.&nbsp; It
will be there, and not at the top, or half-way up, that for the
first time you will realise a finished redemption.&nbsp; If ever
you have the unspeakable joy of saying in all the happiness of
personal appropriation, &lsquo;Thou hast pleaded the causes of my
soul; thou hast redeemed my life,&rsquo; you will have to do so
before you have risen above your present level.&nbsp; Do not
therefore wait to make some poor, feeble, ineffective effort to
rise; but as you are in the midst of your discouragements, though
the stone still seems to stop the mouth of the low dungeon, trust
at once with a bold act of fearless faith, and without waiting to
deserve it, act at once on His own invitation, &lsquo;Return unto
me, for I have redeemed thee.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>But
as for those amongst you that have been brought up out of the
pit, what should be the language of your thankful heart?&nbsp;
You have not only seen the great redemption finished, but you
have experienced its application.&nbsp; You have not merely been
taught to trust Him in the bottom of the low dungeon, but you can
say as David did, &lsquo;He brought me up also out of an horrible
pit, and out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and
established my goings.&rsquo;&nbsp; Ps. xl. 2.&nbsp; If so, will
you not go on and add, &lsquo;He hath put a new song in my mouth,
even thanksgiving unto our God?&rsquo;&nbsp; Will you not join
heart and soul in the language of our Communion Service,
&lsquo;We praise thee, we bless thee, we worship thee, we glorify
thee, we give thanks to thee for thy great glory, O Lord God,
heavenly King, God the Father Almighty?&rsquo;</p>

101</span>IX.&nbsp; ATONEMENT.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of
the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is
every one that hangeth on a tree.&rsquo;&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Gal</span>. iii. 13.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> tracing the doctrine of
redemption through the types and illustrative narratives of the
Old Testament, we found that redemption always includes two
ideas&mdash;deliverance and ransom&mdash;and that in some cases,
as <i>e.g.</i>, in the redemption from Egypt, the deliverance is
the more prominent of the two.&nbsp; I cannot help thinking that
in this respect there is a difference between the Old Testament
and the New.&nbsp; In the New, as well as the Old, the two ideas
are always found, and the deliverance is always included; but the
writers of the New Testament appear to have had their minds so
full of the marvellous love that was shown on the cross of
Christ, that the ransom, and the ransom <a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>price,
appear in many passages to have been the prominent subjects of
their thoughts.&nbsp; Hence it follows that in a great many
religious books, and even in our Church Catechism, redemption is
confounded with the atonement, and people lose sight of the fact
that it includes the consequences of the atonement as well as the
atonement itself, the release of the captive as well as the
payment of the ransom; the actual salvation of the chosen people
of God, as well as the satisfaction of the law by the
substitution of the Son of God for man.&nbsp; In order,
therefore, to get a clear view of the whole subject, we must
consider the two parts separately; first, the ransom,
satisfaction, or atonement, and after that the deliverance that
follows.&nbsp; May it please God in His mercy to give us the
sacred teaching of the Holy Spirit, and to lead us into the full
realisation of the marvellous wonders of His redeeming love!</p>
<p>We must clearly begin with the great subject of the
satisfaction for sin, and the deliverance from the curse, which
was the immediate and first result of it.&nbsp; For this purpose
we cannot have a finer passage than the text.&nbsp; It leads us
straight to the root of the matter, and will <a
name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>suggest
four most important subjects&mdash;the Redeemer Himself, the
curse from which He has redeemed us, the act by which He redeemed
us, and the persons whom He has redeemed.&nbsp; These, if God
permit, we must consider in order.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I.&nbsp; The Redeemer Himself.</p>
<p>It is perfectly clear that unless we know Him, we shall never
understand His work.&nbsp; If there is confusion respecting Him,
there will be confusion respecting all that He has done; so if we
wish to enjoy the salvation, we must begin with the Saviour.</p>
<p>Now in this passage He is described as
&lsquo;Christ.&rsquo;&nbsp; This is the name continually given
Him throughout this Epistle.&nbsp; I know of only one instance in
the whole Epistle in which the name &lsquo;Jesus&rsquo; occurs,
without having either &lsquo;Christ,&rsquo; or &lsquo;The
Christ,&rsquo; attached to it.&nbsp; The reason most probably
was, that St. Paul was writing to Jewish believers, and so made
use of the name by which the expected Redeemer was predicted in
Jewish prophecy.&nbsp; There are, therefore, certain great
lessons to be gathered from the name.</p>
<p><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>(1.)&nbsp; He was the predicted Redeemer.&nbsp; It was
by this name that Daniel foretold His advent and death; for in
Dan. ix. 25, 26, He is predicted as &lsquo;Messiah the
Prince;&rsquo; and it was under this name that the believing Jews
were expecting Him, for Andrew said to his brother, John, i. 41,
&lsquo;We have found the Messias, which is being interpreted the
Christ.&rsquo;</p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; Then again He was the anointed Redeemer.&nbsp; The
meaning of the word Messias, or Christ, is anointed, so that the
title, &lsquo;The Christ,&rsquo; means &lsquo;The Anointed
One;&rsquo; and the words of the text might be rendered,
&lsquo;The anointed One has redeemed us.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now
consider for one moment what was involved in this title.&nbsp; It
conveys the assurance of the eternal purpose of God, and of His
divine appointment of the Lord Jesus to the office.&nbsp; We all
know that the anointing was the act of consecration to the sacred
offices of Prophet, Priest, and King; and we can see at a glance
why Christ was anointed, when set apart to fill an office which
comprehended all the three&mdash;the prophetic, the priestly, and
the royal.&nbsp; His great redeeming act, therefore, was not
merely the result of His own mind and His own benevolence, but it
was the <a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>sacred work unto which He was anointed by the
Father.&nbsp; It was accepted by Himself, and laid upon Him by
God.&nbsp; In undertaking it He had the support of divine
authority, and before He undertook the office He was solemnly set
apart to it by God.</p>
<p>(3.)&nbsp; But there are still further lessons taught us by
this title &lsquo;Christ,&rsquo; for we are taught in the Old
Testament the Anointed One was in all respects qualified for the
redeeming work, inasmuch as He was one of us, and at the same
time was God.&nbsp; Turn to one passage, viz. Ps. xlv. 7.&nbsp;
There we learn that He was a kinsman, and therefore qualified
according to the law to redeem, for the words are, &lsquo;Thy God
hath anointed thee above <i>thy fellows</i>;&rsquo; while at the
same time the sixth verse teaches that the Anointed One is no
other than God Himself, for He is addressed in the words,
&lsquo;Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Such, then, is our Redeemer.&nbsp; He was predicted from the
first day of man&rsquo;s fall; foretold by the whole line of
prophets; expected by the whole line of believers; set apart to
His work in God&rsquo;s eternal purpose; anointed by God; and so,
before men and angels, solemnly consecrated to <a
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>the sacred
work which He was willing in the Father&rsquo;s name to
undertake; and besides all that, he is perfect both in manhood
and Godhead, so that in His own double nature He is one with us
as a kinsman, while He is one with the Father in the omnipotence
of Jehovah.&nbsp; Such is our Redeemer&mdash;can He fail?&nbsp;
Such is our Saviour&mdash;can there be disappointment in trusting
Him?&nbsp; Such is the Lord&rsquo;s Anointed One, and whatever be
the deep wants of our fallen hearts, can we believe for one
moment that He is insufficient to meet the need?&nbsp; Can there
be any doubt respecting the statement of the Psalmist,
&lsquo;With the Lord there is mercy, and with Him is plenteous
redemption?&rsquo; (Ps. cxxx. 7.)</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>II.&nbsp; We may proceed, then, to consider the curse from
which He has redeemed us.&nbsp; According to the text it is the
curse of the law, the curse described in verse 10, where we read,
&lsquo;As many as are of the works of the law are under the
curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not
in all things which are written in the book of the law to do
them.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is most important to bear this well in
mind, for the word &lsquo;curse&rsquo; is so connected <a
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>in common
conversation with that which is vindictive and merciless that
there is danger of our losing sight of the fact that the curse of
God is the calm, deliberate, and even merciful result of the just
judgment of a merciful God.&nbsp; There is no cruelty in the
maintenance of a righteous law, for the maintenance of law is
essential to the happiness of a people.&nbsp; Thus the strict
execution of law is consistent with the most true and tender
affection..&nbsp; David, as the king, was compelled, in the
maintenance of law, to banish Absalom after the murder of Ammon;
but all the while David loved him, and his &lsquo;soul longed to
go forth unto Absalom.&rsquo;&nbsp; So we have heard of judges
moved to tears of tender pity while passing sentence on some
unhappy criminal whom the law compelled them to condemn.&nbsp; In
such a case there was no cruelty in the law, nor any want of
mercy in the judge.&nbsp; The sentence on the sinner was the
necessary and righteous condemnation of the sin.&nbsp; Parliament
was not cruel when it passed the law; the jury was not cruel when
it found the culprit guilty; the judge was not cruel when he
condemned the criminal to death; and the Queen was not cruel when
she signed the warrant for <a name="page108"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 108</span>the execution.&nbsp; Whatever was
done by any one of the parties concerned was done simply because
the maintenance of law is essential to the preservation of life
and order throughout the land.&nbsp; Just so it is with the curse
of the law in the government of God.&nbsp; There is no cruelty in
God&rsquo;s law, or God&rsquo;s execution of its sentence.&nbsp;
The law&mdash;it is holy, just, and good; a perfect law, without
a fault.&nbsp; And the Judge&mdash;He is holy, just, pure,
spotless, and merciful.&nbsp; He willeth not the death of a
sinner, and has no pleasure in the death of him that dieth; and
the curse is not the result of anything vindictive or unmerciful
in Him.&nbsp; It is just like David&rsquo;s sentence on Absalom,
rendered necessary by the claims of a righteous government, and
the necessity of maintaining law.</p>
<p>But, though the sentence is passed in what I may term
&lsquo;loving righteousness,&rsquo; there is something
inexpressibly awful in it.&nbsp; Indeed it is all the more awful
when regarded as the righteous sentence of a God who loves
us.&nbsp; The fact that the sentence is passed, notwithstanding
such love, is itself a proof of its awful importance, and the
clearest possible evidence that a righteous God cannot clear the
guilty, and cannot set <a name="page109"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 109</span>aside the law which He has given to
His people.&nbsp; We must conclude, therefore, that the curse is
certain, and that it cannot be set aside by anything that we can
do.&nbsp; We have no power to deliver ourselves from the awful
curse of the law of God.&nbsp; It is a judgment far more certain,
and far more awful, than that of the wretched criminal in the
condemned cell waiting for execution.&nbsp; It is more awful, for
it cuts us off from God Himself.&nbsp; It hides His countenance;
it separates from His love, and it reaches right away into
eternity.&nbsp; Such is the curse of the law, the curse that
foolish sinners trifle with, the curse that ungodly men bandy
about in foul oaths.&nbsp; It is a just curse&mdash;a curse
inflicted according to law; a curse pronounced by one who loves
the culprit; a curse that could not be set aside unless the
Lawgiver were to neutralise His law, and the righteous King
abandon the holy principles of His kingdom.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>III.&nbsp; So we now turn to the third point,&mdash;the
redemption price, or the great act by which He has redeemed
us.&nbsp; Now, you will observe that with reference to this great
subject there are no illustrations employed in the text.&nbsp;
There is <a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>nothing said about a ransom, or an offering, or any
other illustration; but we are brought at once to the great fact
of the substitution of the Redeemer for the redeemed: &lsquo;He
hath redeemed us from the curse, being made a curse for
us.&rsquo;&nbsp; I know of no way of explaining that passage,
except by the doctrine of substitution.&nbsp; The passage is
exactly like those other words of the Apostle Paul, 2 Cor. v. 21:
&lsquo;He hath made him who knew no sin to be sin for
us.&rsquo;&nbsp; In the one passage the Lord Jesus is said to be
made a curse, and in the other to be made sin; and in both it is
said to have been done &lsquo;for us&rsquo;
(&#8017;&pi;&epsilon;&rho; &#7969;&mu;&#8182;&nu;), <i>i.e.</i>
on our behalf, or in our stead.&nbsp; Now do not suppose that I
do not recognise the depth of mystery involved in this most
wonderful truth.&nbsp; I can sympathise with those that scarcely
know how to grasp it.&nbsp; I know there is a depth about it
beyond the limits of human thought; but there are two
considerations that have always satisfied my own mind.</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; It is not likely that the limited mind of a
short-sighted man should be able to fathom the eternal counsels
of God, and reduce the divine purpose within the compass of his
own <a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>intellect.&nbsp; If we once admit that the plan of
salvation is divine, we must be prepared to meet with many things
far beyond all human thought.&nbsp; So it is in this
instance.&nbsp; The substitution of the spotless Redeemer for the
guilty sinner has in it a breadth, and length, and depth, and
height, that is utterly beyond all human capacity, and to the
very last will pass all knowledge.</p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; We can see the fact throughout the history.&nbsp;
Is there any other way of explaining either the agony in the
garden, or the cry on the cross?&nbsp; Again and again do we see
happy believers stepping down into the valley of the shadow of
death in perfect peace, with a holy joy filling their hearts, and
a holy calm lighting up their countenance; but the Lord Jesus,
when He looked forward to it, was in agony.&nbsp; He sweat, as it
were, great drops of blood, and He cried, &lsquo;If it be
possible, let this cup pass from me.&rsquo;&nbsp; I confess I
know no way of explaining the difference, except by the principle
of substitution, as laid down in this passage, &lsquo;Being made
a curse for us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So, again, I never met with any other explanation of that most
marvellous cry which <a name="page112"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 112</span>He uttered on the cross, when He
exclaimed, &lsquo;My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken
me?&rsquo;&nbsp; How can that cry be explained except by the
doctrine of substitution?&nbsp; Contrast the dying prayer of
Stephen with the dying cry of the Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp;
Stephen said, as I trust you and I may be able to say,
&lsquo;Lord Jesus, receive my spirit,&rsquo; and so in perfect
peace he fell asleep.&nbsp; But the Lord Jesus was forsaken of
God, and so uttered that bitter cry.&nbsp; How can we explain the
difference?&nbsp; How can we understand the marvellous
contrast?&nbsp; I never could see any explanation but one, and
that is, in the doctrine of substitution.&nbsp; The Lord Jesus
was made a curse in the place of Stephen, so Stephen was
free.&nbsp; The sin of Stephen was imputed to the Son of God, and
the righteousness of the Son of God was imputed to Stephen; so
the Lord Jesus cried under the burden of the curse, &lsquo;My
God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?&rsquo; and Stephen prayed
in the peaceful enjoyment of full reconciliation, &lsquo;Lord
Jesus, receive my spirit.&rsquo;&nbsp; The burden of the curse
was too awful for us to bear, and too righteous for God to set
aside.&nbsp; So the Lord, in boundless mercy, and with His own
full consent, <a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>laid it on Him.&nbsp; There was a transfer of the
imputation of guilt, and thus by God&rsquo;s marvellous grace,
blessed be God, in Christ Jesus we are free.</p>
<p>Now all this is done, and done for ever.&nbsp; Nothing can add
to it, and nothing can take from it.&nbsp; We have nothing to do
with any fresh sacrifice for sin.&nbsp; We want no masses for
either the living or the dead, and we know we cannot make up any
fresh sacrifice by penance or self-denial.&nbsp; In all such
matters the one question is, Is the one redemption by the one
substitute sufficient, or is it not?&nbsp; If it is, we want no
further sacrifice, for the work is done.&nbsp; If it is not, we
may give up in despair, for it must be obvious to any man that if
the substitution of the Son of God fall short of the requirements
of the law, nothing that we can add can ever supply the
deficiency.&nbsp; But, thanks be to God, there is no room for
discussion.&nbsp; As we are taught in our Communion Service,
&lsquo;He made there (by His one oblation of Himself once
offered) a full, perfect, and sufficient sacrifice, oblation, and
satisfaction for the sins of the whole world.&rsquo;&nbsp; He was
Himself the Anointed <a name="page114"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 114</span>One of God, even the Son of
God.&nbsp; In His death He fulfilled the covenant of God.&nbsp;
In His resurrection He was accepted as having completed the work
of God; in His ascension He entered into the holy place, by one
offering having perfected for ever them that are sanctified.</p>
<p>And now what is the result?&nbsp; What is the consequence of
this completed act of substitution?&nbsp; Surely nothing short of
this, that every soul found in Him is legally free.&nbsp; Of
course I am not speaking of those who reject that substitution or
live without Him.&nbsp; They must bear their own burden; and an
awful burden, I fear, they will find it.&nbsp; I am speaking of
those who accept Him as their representative, and are one with
Him as their substitute.&nbsp; Now to any one of them the great
act of substitution has brought a full, complete, legal
release.&nbsp; They are as free from the curse of the law as if
they had never sinned.&nbsp; The law has no more power to condemn
them than if it had never been issued, or if they had never
broken it.&nbsp; They are washed white as snow in the blood of
the Lamb, and there is no condemnation for them <a
name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>that are in
Christ Jesus.&nbsp; So there we may rest in calm, happy, peaceful
trust, for the law is satisfied, and the curse is removed.&nbsp;
In His agony we see our peace, in His death our life, and in His
bitter cry on the cross our full, perfect, and everlasting
reconciliation to God.</p>
<h2><a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
116</span>X.&nbsp; ATONEMENT.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of
the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is
every one that hangeth on a tree.&rsquo;&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Gal</span>. iii. 13.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> we considered this passage in
the last lecture, we did not complete the subject.&nbsp; We found
who the Redeemer was, viz. the Christ.&nbsp; We found what it was
that He redeemed us from, viz. the curse, or just judgment of
God&rsquo;s righteous law.&nbsp; We found also what was the
redemption price, or great redeeming act, viz. the substitution
of the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God for the sinner.&nbsp;
But there is a fourth point of the utmost possible importance
which we had not time to investigate, viz. the question for whom,
or in whose behalf, this great work was accomplished by the
Saviour.&nbsp; But there is no part of the subject more vitally
affecting our own practical life; for unless the Lord Jesus was a
substitute for <a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
117</span>ourselves, we as individuals may admire His mercy, but
can never have a share in the blessing of His saving work.&nbsp;
So far as we ourselves are personally concerned, our whole hope
depends on our being included in that little word
&lsquo;us,&rsquo; when it is said, &lsquo;Christ hath redeemed us
from the curse of the law, being made a curse for
us.&rsquo;&nbsp; If we cannot each one make use of that sentence
in the singular number, and say, &lsquo;Christ hath redeemed
<i>me</i>, being made a curse for <i>me</i>,&rsquo; the passage
may call forth our admiration, but to our own souls it will bring
no abiding peace.&nbsp; It is, therefore, a matter of the deepest
personal interest to us all that we should clearly understand who
is included, and who is not included, in that word
&lsquo;us;&rsquo; or, in other words, who are they that the Lord
Jesus Christ has redeemed by His blood.</p>
<p>It would have been strange indeed if a matter of such
overwhelming interest had been quietly passed by without calling
forth a very careful investigation, and accordingly it gave rise
at one time to one of the most prominent controversies of the
day.&nbsp; Indeed there has always been a division amongst the
students of the Word of God on the subject.&nbsp; Some have
believed in <a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>what is termed &lsquo;particular redemption,&rsquo; a
redemption limited exclusively to the elect; while others have
most earnestly advocated the doctrine of a universal atonement,
an atonement, <i>i.e.</i> made for the whole world in virtue of
which a free offer of complete reconciliation is made without
money and without price to every living soul.</p>
<p>It is my own belief that a great deal of the confusion
respecting the subject arises from the indistinct use of words;
and I am thoroughly persuaded that before we can ascertain whom
He has redeemed, we must clearly understand what is meant by
redemption.&nbsp; If we do not understand redemption itself, we
shall never understand its limits.&nbsp; Now I cannot help
thinking that I have proved that, throughout the word of God,
redemption means deliverance; and in the case of the great
salvation, deliverance through atonement.&nbsp; In some passages
the delivering power is more prominent than in others, as, for
example, in Luke, xxi. 28, and Rom. viii. 23; but in all it is
there, and I do not know of a single passage in which redemption
stands for atonement alone as disconnected with the consequent
deliverance.&nbsp; Whenever it occurs it implies atonement
applied, or atonement enjoyed, <a name="page119"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 119</span>atonement made effectual for the
actual salvation of the soul.&nbsp; But, though it is thus clear
in the word of God, there is great confusion in many religious
books.&nbsp; Many writers appear to speak of atonement and
redemption as if they were the same, and so apply to redemption
passages which speak only of atonement, and apply to atonement
those texts which refer, not to atonement only, but also to the
actual deliverance for which atonement has prepared the
way.&nbsp; It is most important, therefore, that we should keep
the distinction clearly in view, and never forget that the
redemption of the Gospel includes two parts, deliverance and
atonement.&nbsp; The two are bound together as intimately as it
is possible.&nbsp; The deliverance is the consequence of
atonement, and the atonement is the cause of deliverance, but
both one and the other are included in the full idea of
redemption, as we may see, for example, in the song sung before
the throne, &lsquo;Thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God
by thy blood, out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and
nation.&rsquo;&nbsp; Rev. v. 9.&nbsp; That passage clearly goes
far beyond the act of substitution in redeeming mercy, for it
manifestly <a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
120</span>includes an actual separation and salvation by
delivering power.</p>
<p>Now, if we consider redemption in its full and complete sense
of actual deliverance through the precious blood of the Lamb, it
is perfectly clear that none but the elect of God are included in
the blessing.&nbsp; As a matter of fact the rest are not
delivered.&nbsp; According to St. John, the whole world lieth in
wickedness, and if it is still lying in wickedness in no sense
whatever can it be said to be delivered.&nbsp; None but the
chosen people of God can ever say, &lsquo;Who hath delivered us
from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the
kingdom of his dear Son.&rsquo;&nbsp; Col. i. 13.&nbsp; As for
the rest they do not profess to be delivered.&nbsp; Some do not
even wish for the great deliverance; some, though they may feel a
certain languid wish for it, never in earnest seek for it; and
others, if they do seek, seek in a wrong way, and so never
find.&nbsp; The result is, that practically they are not
delivered.&nbsp; Thus we all acknowledge a particular, or
limited, deliverance.&nbsp; We none believe that all are saved;
and we must believe that the Lord Jesus actually delivers those
only who are His own, those whom <a name="page121"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 121</span>He describes in the words,
&lsquo;The men which thou gavest me out of the world.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But suppose we take redemption in the sense in which it is
perpetually employed in religious books, viz., as meaning the
same as atonement, there arises another question of incalculable
importance which demands our most attentive consideration.&nbsp;
Is the atonement limited as well as the deliverance?&nbsp; It is
perfectly clear that none are delivered but God&rsquo;s chosen
people.&nbsp; They, and they only, are plucked as brands from the
burning, and eternally saved.&nbsp; According to the 17th
Article, God &lsquo;hath constantly decreed by His counsel secret
to us, to deliver from curse and damnation those whom He hath
chosen in Christ out of mankind, and to bring them by Christ to
everlasting salvation, as vessels made to honour.&rsquo;&nbsp;
But is nothing done for the remainder?&nbsp; In other words, did
the substitution of the Lord Jesus Christ extend to the whole
world, or did it not?&nbsp; Was atonement made for all mankind in
that marvellous act of mercy, or were the great majority left out
altogether most miserably to perish, without any hope of
deliverance, and without the possibility of being saved in the <a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>Lord
Jesus?&nbsp; It is impossible to imagine a question of more
urgent importance to all those who are anxious about their
souls.</p>
<p>Now I am perfectly aware of the argument frequently urged,
that the Lord Jesus Christ is certain to save all those for whom
He shed His blood, and I am quite prepared to acknowledge that,
humanly speaking, there is great apparent reason in it.&nbsp; But
I do not believe that it is according to Scripture; and after all
we must rely in all such matters on the statements of God&rsquo;s
word, and not on our own conclusions.&nbsp; I would refer you,
then, to two passages which certainly seem to be conclusive on
that point.&nbsp; The one is 1 Cor. viii. 11, &lsquo;Through thy
knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ
died?&rsquo;&nbsp; The other is 2 Pet. ii. 1, where, predicting
the dangers of the latter days, the Apostle says, &lsquo;There
shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in
damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and
bring upon themselves swift destruction.&rsquo;&nbsp; The first
of these texts seems certainly to teach very clearly that those
for whom Christ died may perish, and the other that people for
whom the Lord had given the redemption price <a
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>of His own
most precious blood may still deny Him, and bring upon themselves
swift destruction.&nbsp; We must not therefore be guided in such
a matter by our own conclusions.&nbsp; The whole plan from first
to last is divine.&nbsp; The eternal purpose is divine; the
Saviour is divine; the salvation is divine; the atonement is
divine, and the revelation of the great purpose must likewise be
divine.&nbsp; We must not attempt, therefore, to cut our system
square by the rule of our own opinion, but must take God&rsquo;s
Scripture just as it stands, and receive God&rsquo;s salvation
just as He has revealed it in His Word.</p>
<p>What, then, has He revealed?&nbsp; That is the question.&nbsp;
Has He taught us that the Lord Jesus Christ shed His most
precious blood for the elect alone or for all?&nbsp; Blessed be
God! the testimony of Scripture appears as plain as the sun in
heaven that the atonement was made for all, and that in
consequence of that atonement the door is thrown open to every
sinner upon earth.&nbsp; I have no time now to attempt to bring
before you the multitude of passages which abound in Scripture in
proof of this position.&nbsp; I must be content to draw your
attention to only three, the first relating <a
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>to the fact
itself, the second to the love that led to it, and the third to
the offer made in consequence of it.</p>
<p>The first is from 1 John, ii. 2.&nbsp; But before you examine
it, turn for one moment to the words of the same apostle in the
fifth chapter of the same epistle, and 19th verse, &lsquo;We are
of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedness.&rsquo;&nbsp;
That verse shows with indisputable clearness who is meant by
&lsquo;we,&rsquo; and who by &lsquo;the world.&rsquo;&nbsp; By
&lsquo;we&rsquo; is meant the people of God, believers, the
elect.&nbsp; By the world the rest of mankind, those who live and
die unconverted and unsaved.&nbsp; And now turn to the passage in
the second chapter, &lsquo;And he is the propitiation for our
sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole
world.&rsquo;&nbsp; Surely the &lsquo;our&rsquo; in that verse
must refer to the same persons as the &lsquo;we&rsquo; in the
fifth chapter, and &lsquo;the whole world&rsquo; in the second
chapter must be the same as &lsquo;the whole world&rsquo; in the
fifth.&nbsp; But if so it is perfectly clear that He died not for
the elect alone but for all mankind; for the whole world that
lieth in wickedness.</p>
<p>From the second passage we learn exactly the same respecting
the love that led to it.&nbsp; I <a name="page125"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 125</span>refer to John, iii. 16.&nbsp; But
before we refer to it let us turn to another text in explanation,
viz., that most wonderful prayer of our blessed Saviour in John,
xvii. 6, &lsquo;I have manifested thy name unto the men which
thou gavest me out of the world; thine they were, and thou gavest
them me; and they have kept thy word.&rsquo;&nbsp; You will
observe in these words the clear distinction between the world
and the elect.&nbsp; The mass of men are described as the world,
while the elect are said to be given to Him out of it, set apart
as a separate people, and given Him in the covenant of God.&nbsp;
And now turn to the passage in John, iii., &lsquo;God so loved
the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son, that whosoever
believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting
life.&rsquo;&nbsp; Surely we must take &lsquo;the world&rsquo;
here in the same sense as in the other passage.&nbsp; It is
impossible to believe that by &lsquo;the world&rsquo; he meant
the elect of God given Him from out of the world, the peculiar
people whom He Himself most carefully distinguishes from the
world.&nbsp; Surely, then, we must conclude that the love which
moved Him to make the atonement was a love for us all, a free
love, an <a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
126</span>unmerited love, a compassionate love, a most merciful
love, to every individual involved in the ruin of the fall.</p>
<p>We are brought to exactly the same conclusion if we look at
the offer that results from it.&nbsp; Turn to that magnificent
invitation which we find just at the conclusion of the book of
life, Rev. xxii. 17, &lsquo;And the Spirit and the bride say,
Come.&nbsp; And let him that heareth say, Come.&nbsp; And let him
that is athirst come; and whosoever will, let him take the water
of life freely.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now if you study that verse you find
the Bride employed in proclaiming God&rsquo;s invitation.&nbsp;
Who then is meant by the Bride?&nbsp; Surely nothing else than
the church of God&rsquo;s elect; those who were chosen in Him
before the world was.&nbsp; But how is the Bride to be
employed?&nbsp; What is to be her work as described in this
passage?&nbsp; Is it not to go forth in the Lord&rsquo;s name,
and proclaim to the perishing the free offer of His saving
grace?&nbsp; &lsquo;The Spirit and the bride say, Come.&nbsp; And
let him that heareth say, Come.&nbsp; And let him that is
athirst, come: and whosoever will let him take the water of life
freely.&rsquo;&nbsp; Would it be possible to construct <a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>a sentence
which would proclaim more clearly a universal invitation? an
invitation to be given by the elect to all the world?</p>
<p>Surely, then, we may every one of us accept that offer, and
regard the atonement as an atonement made for ourselves.&nbsp;
You may see no evidence of your election.&nbsp; You may look into
your own heart, and find there nothing whatever to lead you to
believe that you are one of God&rsquo;s chosen people.&nbsp; But
you are not called to wait till you have discovered such
evidence; and if you do wait, you may wait for ever, for it is
perfectly impossible that you should ever have evidence of your
election till after you have trusted in His atoning blood.&nbsp;
But without any such evidence you may fall back on the finished
substitution of the Son of God for the sinner.&nbsp; You may take
the words of this text, &lsquo;Being made a curse for us,&rsquo;
and, whatever you are, may put it in the singular number, and
say, &lsquo;Being made a curse for me,&rsquo; yes! &lsquo;for me,
even for me.&rsquo;&nbsp; If, therefore, you are really anxious
about the salvation of your soul, do not stop to search into your
own sinful heart for evidences of your election; but fall boldly
on the fact that, whether you are elected or not, Christ Jesus
was <a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>your
substitute.&nbsp; Cleave to the fact that the propitiation was
for the world, that the love that moved God to it was a love to
the world; and that the offer made in consequence of it is an
offer to the world.&nbsp; Trust that.&nbsp; Accept that.&nbsp;
Rest in that, and leave it to God to settle the matter of your
election; for of this you may be perfectly sure that you will
never enjoy any evidence of your election unto life until you
have learned to trust the Lord Jesus Christ, and His perfect work
without it.&nbsp; You must learn a lesson from that poor woman of
Canaan.&nbsp; She was apparently quite shut out by the doctrine
of election, for she was not one of the lost sheep of the house
of Israel, and the Lord Himself said to her that it was not right
to take the children&rsquo;s bread and cast it to dogs.&nbsp; But
she was not discouraged by the difficulty.&nbsp; She pleaded,
&lsquo;Yet the dogs eat of the crumbs that fall from the
Master&rsquo;s table;&rsquo; and the result was that she did not
merely pick up the crumbs, but she was made partaker of the feast
itself, and went to her home rejoicing in our Lord&rsquo;s
approval, and her daughter&rsquo;s cure.</p>
<p>Let us all then accept the fact that in His boundless mercy He
was made a curse for us.&nbsp; <a name="page129"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 129</span>But we must bear in mind at the same
time, that He does not force upon us the blessings of that
substitution.&nbsp; If we choose to live without the substitute
we may.&nbsp; If people are so occupied by the world that they do
not care for it; or so satisfied with themselves that they do not
feel the need of it; or so unmindful of the holiness of God that
they cannot see the necessity of it; they are at full liberty to
reject it, and have full power to live without it.&nbsp; But
then, it is obvious they must bear their own burden, and all the
weight of it.&nbsp; The Lord Jesus has satisfied the law as their
substitute; but if they decline to accept that satisfaction, it
is perfectly clear that there is nothing left for them but to
satisfy it for themselves.&nbsp; They must blot out their own
curse in their own way, and how they are going to do it I cannot
tell.&nbsp; I know of nothing but Christ the substitute that can
remove the just judgment of a broken law; and if men live and die
without Him, I see no prospect for them but that they live in
their sin, and die in their sin, and go down into eternity with
the whole of the awful weight of unforgiven sin resting on their
poor unforgiven souls.&nbsp; And who can say that such a sentence
would be hard, <a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>or severe, or unjust?&nbsp; If there were no substitute
provided we might possibly think the law severe.&nbsp; But, now
that in boundless mercy God has Himself provided the substitute,
who can say that it is a hard measure if the sinner is crushed
under the burden which he resolves to bear?</p>

satisfaction made for sin by the atoning sacrifice of the Son of

deliverance.&nbsp; But we do not want to have either a building
without a foundation, or a foundation without a building.&nbsp;
In other words, we do not wish either to have a superficial life
of Christian experience without a solid foundation in the great
work of atonement, or to be so exclusively occupied by the
atonement as to forget the <a name="page132"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 132</span>great practical deliverance which is
in fact the completion of redeeming grace.&nbsp; Having laid the
foundation, then, in the study of the ransom, redemption price,
or satisfaction for sin, we must pass on to the great deliverance
with which God follows up His work of mercy.&nbsp; This we will
now do, if God permit, and may He Himself put forth the mighty
power of the Holy Spirit, and this very day in His own grace
deliver souls!</p>
<p>Now what is the first great gift of God in delivering
souls?&mdash;the first result of the blood of atonement when
applied to the salvation of the sinner?&nbsp; I hope that if we
were all to speak we should give the same answer to the question,
and that there are none amongst us who would hesitate to reply,
&lsquo;Forgiveness.&rsquo;&nbsp; So long as sin remains
unforgiven there can be no freedom, nor any deliverance of any
kind whatever.&nbsp; Unforgiven sin blocks the way against all
hope of escape, and therefore when God invites a sinner to return
He first assures him of the blotting out of sin: &lsquo;I have
blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a
cloud, thy sins: return unto me, for I have redeemed thee.&rsquo;
(Isa. xliv. 22.)</p>
<p><a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>But
now arises a question which has sometimes occasioned difficulty
in thoughtful minds.&nbsp; A complete forgiveness is the
starting-point of the Christian&rsquo;s life; and accordingly
this forgiveness of sin is described as a complete and present
privilege, so we read, &lsquo;In whom,&rsquo; <i>i.e.</i>, in
Christ the Beloved One, &lsquo;we have redemption through his
blood, the forgiveness of sins.&rsquo;&nbsp; The apostle speaks
of it there as something of which we are now in the present
enjoyment, for he says, &lsquo;We have it.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is
ours now.&nbsp; But yet in other passages, such as the
Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, the children of God are taught to ask for it
with as much regularity as for their daily bread.&nbsp; How is
it, then, that we are told to ask for that we have already?&nbsp;
Why do we pray the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer every day when we already
have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins?&nbsp;
It is a very natural question, and I cannot be surprised if
persons feel the difficulty.&nbsp; But I believe that if we look
carefully at the real work of redemption it will throw great
light on the subject.&nbsp; We shall find if we do so that there
are two kinds of forgiveness described in the word of God, the
one the immediate, and the other the consequent, result of
redemption.&nbsp; <a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
134</span>There is judicial forgiveness as the foundation, and
parental forgiveness as the consequence: the two being closely
connected with each other, and both resulting from
redemption.&nbsp; Let us study them separately.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I.&nbsp; Judicial forgiveness.</p>
<p>In order to understand judicial forgiveness we must consider
the judicial condemnation of the unforgiven man, and we must
carefully remember God&rsquo;s offices as King, as Lawgiver, and
as Judge.&nbsp; He is a Saviour, but He is a ruler likewise, and
He rules the world in righteousness.&nbsp; But if we think of Him
as the great executive of a perfectly righteous and holy law,
acting on principles of strict and unvarying righteousness, we
must see in a moment that we have all been brought under judicial
condemnation, for the law condemns us all.&nbsp; It condemned our
whole race in the person of our head and first father when Adam
sinned, and the sentence of death was passed on him as the
representative of man.&nbsp; It condemns our nature as alien and
strange to God.&nbsp; And it condemns our lives that have
abounded in action contrary to His will.&nbsp; I know that some
<a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>people
find a difficulty in the first two points, and cannot understand
the condemnation of the race, or of the nature.&nbsp; I can
appreciate their difficulty, though I am quite sure it is fully
met in Scripture.&nbsp; But I have not time to discuss it
now.&nbsp; But this one thing I am sure is plain; even if there
were no condemnation on the race or on the nature, there is quite
sufficient in the past life to bring condemnation on any soul
amongst us.&nbsp; Even if we had not been condemned in Adam there
has been quite sufficient to condemn us in ourselves.&nbsp; There
is not one amongst us who is not guilty of that for which he
knows himself to be responsible.&nbsp; There is not one who dare
stand before God on the plea that he has never sinned, not one
therefore that must not acknowledge in some form or other that he
cannot be saved if the sentence of the law is to be carried out
on his sin.</p>
<p>But if you think over it you will see that according to
natural principle judicial forgiveness is impossible.&nbsp; Law
can acquit, and law can condemn, but law cannot forgive.&nbsp;
Law can pronounce a man innocent, and law can pass the sentence
of death, but law cannot pardon the guilty.&nbsp; Our legal
position by nature is <a name="page136"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 136</span>perfectly hopeless.&nbsp; We have
incurred a legal and just condemnation, but nature has made no
provision for a legal and just forgiveness.&nbsp; It is the
effort to overcome this insuperable difficulty that has kept
thousands of conscientious heathen toiling on throughout their
lives in deep religious anxiety without a ray of light to throw
peace upon their path.</p>
<p>But the whole difficulty is met in God&rsquo;s great plan of
redemption, as revealed in those wonderful words, &lsquo;Christ
hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse
for us.&rsquo;&nbsp; The forgiveness resulting from the great act
of redemption is exactly what we want, a legal and judicial
remission of a legal and judicial sentence.&nbsp; The sentence of
the law has been as fully carried out in the person of our most
Blessed Redeemer as it would have been had the whole race been
cast into hell for ever.&nbsp; The whole difficulty is removed by
the principle of substitution, or satisfaction.&nbsp; If Christ
was made a curse for us, then the curse is gone from us, and we
are free.&nbsp; The holiness of the law is honoured, the
righteousness of the lawgiver is preserved, the sentence of the
judge is established, not one jot or one tittle of the law is <a
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>allowed to
pass; but, notwithstanding all, the man that has broken it,
although he has broken it, is absolutely free.&nbsp; Thus, in
Rom. iii. 26, we are taught that the result of propitiation is,
&lsquo;That God might be just, and yet the justifier of him which
believeth in Jesus.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here, therefore, we have what I have termed a judicial
forgiveness, a forgiveness in perfect harmony with the strict
righteousness of law; a forgiveness which is, in fact, the
letting forth of God&rsquo;s eternal love when all legal claims
are satisfied.&nbsp; Till that redeeming act was complete, the
love was as it were pent up, and could not, in consistency with
His own law, flow forth to a condemned people.&nbsp; But all is
different now.&nbsp; The law itself pronounces in favour of the
condemned, and the result is that God is not only faithful, but
just to forgive.&nbsp; And to this righteous forgiveness we may
apply the text, &lsquo;In whom we have redemption through his
blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his
grace.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>II.&nbsp; Parental Forgiveness.&nbsp; But when we are in the
enjoyment of this judicial forgiveness it may be said, &lsquo;If
this be <a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span>the case, why should we any more pray for
forgiveness?&nbsp; Why should we say the Lord&rsquo;s
prayer?&nbsp; Are we not taught that we already have forgiveness
as we have redemption through His blood?&nbsp; To answer this
question we must mark the distinction between judicial and
parental forgiveness.</p>
<p>Consider, then, the position into which every believer is
brought through redemption and judicial forgiveness.&nbsp;
According to verse 6, we are &lsquo;accepted in the
Beloved,&rsquo; accepted, <i>i.e.</i>, in Christ Jesus the
Beloved One.&nbsp; And according to Gal. iv. 5, we are made, by
virtue of that redemption, children of God, for Christ was sent
forth &lsquo;to redeem them that were under the law, that we
might receive the adoption of sons.&rsquo;&nbsp; If, then, we be
in Christ Jesus, what is our position?&nbsp; The curse which fell
on the whole race through Adam is gone, and we shall soon rise
from the dead into new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth
righteousness.&nbsp; The condemnation of our sinful and ruined
nature as well as of all the sin of all our past lives is
forgiven for ever; and much more than that, for, the barriers
being all broken down, we are accepted in the Beloved and
&lsquo;the Spirit itself beareth witness <a
name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>with our
spirit that we are the children of God.&rsquo;</p>
<p>What, then, is the consequence of this new position?&nbsp; And
what does it involve?&nbsp; Nothing less than a parental and
filial union.&nbsp; In Christ Jesus you have a Father who loves
you, a Father whom you love; a Father who cares for you, and on
whose care you may confidently trust; a Father who speaks to your
soul by His Spirit, and who admits you into close and
confidential intimacy with Himself.&nbsp; Now it is perfectly
clear, that as you pass through life, it will be the joy of your
heart to please that loving Father.&nbsp; The more you love Him,
the more you will rejoice to please Him, and He gives you the
assurance that your efforts, defective though they be, do please
Him, for we are told not to forget to do good, and to
communicate, &lsquo;for with such sacrifices God is well
pleased.&rsquo;&nbsp; (Heb. xiii. 16.)&nbsp; But, on the other
hand, you may grieve Him.&nbsp; I can never forget the tender
love of my dearest mother, or how fondly I loved her in
return.&nbsp; I have the greatest satisfaction also in the
recollection of her pleasure as she witnessed my boyish efforts
to carry out her wishes and those of my father.&nbsp; But I can
look back to more <a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
140</span>than fifty years ago and remember one or two sad days
in which I pained her.&nbsp; Oh, dear children! never pain your
mother, for the thought may remain with you long after she is in
the grave, long after the time when you can no more throw your
arms round her neck, and ask her forgiveness for what you have
said or done to grieve her.&nbsp; Now it is just the same with
our Heavenly Father.&nbsp; We may love Him, truly love Him, love
Him without a doubt.&nbsp; Moreover, we may please Him, please
Him well in all things, and bring to His service that offering of
the whole man with which he is well pleased.&nbsp; But we may
also grieve Him, and I fear we often do.&nbsp; The free
forgiveness through redeeming blood has not removed, eradicated,
or laid to rest the old sinful human nature.&nbsp; Thus St. Paul
tells us to &lsquo;grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye
are sealed unto the day of redemption,&rsquo; Eph. iv. 30; and he
shows us how we may do so, viz., by corrupt communication,
bitterness, wrath, anger, clamour, evil speaking and
malice.&nbsp; Do you think that a bad temper does not grieve Him,
or unkind conversation, or pride of heart, or wandering thoughts
in prayer, or any of the thousand <a name="page141"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 141</span>things that may rise before the
conscience of those who are not satisfied with a superficial
Christian life?&nbsp; But if this be the case what do we
want,&mdash;want day by day as we pass through life?&nbsp; Surely
the parental forgiveness, the loving forgiveness of a loving
Father, watching in love over His loving child, and with a
Father&rsquo;s love, and a Father&rsquo;s authority, accepting
the acknowledgment of sin, and day by day freely forgiving
it.&nbsp; This perfectly explains the use of the Lord&rsquo;s
prayer by the children of God.&nbsp; We come to Him in that
prayer as our Father, and because He is our Father we ask Him as
a Father to forgive us our sins.&nbsp; This does not supersede
the judicial forgiveness, but is the consequence of it.&nbsp; Nor
does it set aside redemption, for it is on redemption that the
whole sonship depends.&nbsp; There is nothing independent of that
most precious blood of Christ.&nbsp; It is through that blood of
His that the curse is removed, and the judicial forgiveness
granted; through that blood of His that we receive the adoption
of sons, and are brought into the sacred relationship of children
in a Father&rsquo;s family.&nbsp; It is through that blood of His
that we are preserved in that relationship, and stand before the
Father in a covenant union <a name="page142"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 142</span>with the Son of God Himself.&nbsp;
But resting on this power of the atoning blood, there is a great
deal besides judicial forgiveness.&nbsp; If you be asking now the
way of life, and anxious that all the sins of all your life may
be blotted out, that so you may be saved from the condemnation of
the law; then your only hope must be in the plenteous redemption
wrought out for you on the cross when the Son of God redeemed you
from the curse, being made a curse for you.&nbsp; And, thanks be
to God! that is sufficient, for it has broken down every barrier,
and set the way of life wide open before the chief of
sinners.&nbsp; But if you have been saved from that condemnation,
so that now you &lsquo;have redemption through his blood, the
forgiveness of sins:&rsquo; you have also a great deal more, for
you have besides it and resting on it, the unspeakable
blessedness of a Father&rsquo;s love.&nbsp; You may daily fall
back on the satisfaction of the law, and in consequence of that
satisfaction, like loving children may cry, &lsquo;Abba,
Father,&rsquo; and claim a Father&rsquo;s forbearance and a
Father&rsquo;s tenderness, a Father&rsquo;s provision, and a
Father&rsquo;s forgiveness.&nbsp; It is this parental love that
is the joy of our hearts when we kneel together round our
Father&rsquo;s table, this parental <a name="page143"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 143</span>forgiveness for which we pray when
we say, &lsquo;Our Father which art in heaven, forgive us our
trespasses.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Let us endeavour, then, to realise the legal condemnation
gone; the judicial forgiveness granted; the adoption of sons
bestowed; the Father&rsquo;s table spread; the Father&rsquo;s
forgiveness ready; the Father&rsquo;s love shed abroad in our
hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given us.&nbsp; And realizing
this, shall we not draw near in faith?&nbsp; Shall we not confess
to Him that we are heartily sorry for all our misdoings?&nbsp;
Shall we not ask Him for His parental forgiveness?&nbsp; Shall we
not feed at His table?&nbsp; Shall we not rest on His loving
arm?&nbsp; Shall we not regard it as our chief joy to please
Him?&nbsp; And shall we not out of the fulness of loving hearts
exalt His name for the unspeakable riches of redeeming love; and
praise Him from the bottom of our hearts that by His marvellous
grace we even now &lsquo;have redemption through his blood, the
forgiveness of sins?&rsquo; and having it, can appeal to a
Father&rsquo;s love for daily forgiveness as for daily bread?</p>
<h2><a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>XII.&nbsp; PURITY.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Who gave himself for us, that he might
redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar
people, zealous of good works.&rsquo;&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Tit</span>. ii. 14.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">If</span> we wish to understand the
various passages in the word of God on the subject of redemption,
we must never forget the two parts of which redemption consists,
so often brought before you in these lectures&mdash;the
satisfaction of the law by the payment of redemption price, and
the actual deliverance of the ransomed people as the result of
the finished atonement.&nbsp; It is of especial importance that
we bear this well in mind in the study of those texts in which
redemption is spoken of as being either now in progress or still
in the future, for there is no possibility of any present or
future atonement, that having been for ever completed on Calvary,
and such passages can only refer to the work of deliverance which
will not be complete till the glorious <a
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>day of our
Lord&rsquo;s appearing.&nbsp; The atonement is complete, but the
deliverance is in progress still, and those texts refer to
it.</p>
<p>I believe that this remark is of great importance to the right
understanding of this text.&nbsp; It occurs in the midst of one
of the most practical chapters in the Bible.&nbsp; The words are
addressed to the various different classes of society.&nbsp; Aged
men are exhorted to be sober and sound in faith; aged women to be
in behaviour as becometh godliness; young women to be sober and
to love their husbands and their children; servants to be
obedient, pleasant, not contradictory, and honest; and all of us
to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts, and to live soberly,
righteously, and godly in this present world.</p>
<p>Now, according to the text, the great motive power to all this
is the fact that our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ
&lsquo;gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all
iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people zealous of
good works.&rsquo;&nbsp; Let us study then the redemption work,
and the redemption power; and may God the Holy Ghost so bless it
to our souls that we may be led in practical life to adorn the
doctrine of God our Saviour in all things!</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
146</span>I.&nbsp; The redemption work.</p>
<p>To redeem in these words clearly means to deliver, as the
result of the finished atonement.&nbsp; The foundation of the
deliverance is the fact that our great God and Saviour Jesus
Christ gave Himself for us.&nbsp; The actual deliverance is
described in the words, &lsquo;that he might redeem us from all
iniquity.&rsquo;&nbsp; A question has arisen as to the meaning of
this expression.&nbsp; Does it mean that He might redeem us from
the curse and judgment of all iniquity and so set us legally
free, as when He said, &lsquo;Christ hath redeemed us from the
curse of the law, being made a curse for us?&rsquo; or does it
mean that by the power of the Holy Ghost He might deliver us from
the bondage of all iniquity, and so make us actually a holy
people unto Himself?&nbsp; There is much to be said for both
interpretations.&nbsp; &lsquo;Iniquity&rsquo; may stand here for
the curse, or guilt, of iniquity, as &lsquo;sin&rsquo; stands for
the guilt of sin in 1 Pet. ii. 24: &lsquo;Who his own self bare
our sins in his own body on the tree.&rsquo;&nbsp; Or it may
stand for sin itself, and its deadly power over the ruined
soul.&nbsp; I am inclined on the whole to prefer this latter
application, and to believe that the words describe the actual
deliverance from the dominion <a name="page147"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 147</span>of sin.&nbsp; The context clearly
points in that direction, and so, as far as I can judge, do the
words.&nbsp; The word here rendered iniquity strictly means
&lsquo;lawlessness.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is the same word as that in 1
John, iii. 4, where it is translated &lsquo;transgression of the
law,&rsquo; and appears generally to express the actual
disobedience to the law, or will of God.&nbsp; If this be the
case the idea evidently is that in our natural condition we are
slaves and bondsmen to disobedience, or lawlessness.&nbsp; But
that the great God and Saviour made an atonement for us in order
that He might set us free from that dreadful yoke, and call us
out to be a people set apart for His praise.&nbsp; This is in
harmony with what we are taught in Rom. vi. 19, for there we are
described as having in former times &lsquo;yielded our members as
servants to uncleanness and to iniquity&rsquo; (the same word),
and as now being set free by the grace of God.&nbsp; But there
can be no such freedom without redemption from the curse of
sin.&nbsp; You remember that when a man had sold himself to be a
slave, the only way in which he could obtain his liberty was by
his kinsman legally redeeming him from his master.&nbsp; So it
seems to be here.&nbsp; Christ our kinsman has paid the ransom <a
name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>in order
that we, being redeemed, may be freemen unto God, and may now as
freemen have the joy of serving Him.</p>
<p>But this is not all that is done for us, or nearly so, for the
text does not merely refer to the bondage from which He died to
deliver us, but leads us also to consider the new life to which
He came to raise us.&nbsp; It takes the positive side as well as
the negative.&nbsp; It looks forward as well as backward.&nbsp;
It describes the new-master to whom being redeemed we belong, as
well as the old master from whom by redemption we are
delivered.&nbsp; Now you see this transfer very clearly in the
text.&nbsp; The old master is lawlessness, the new master is
Christ Himself.&nbsp; He came to redeem us from all iniquity, and
&lsquo;purify unto himself a peculiar people.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Peculiar&rsquo; does not mean odd, or eccentric; but
special, and separated, as you may see by a comparison of Deut.
vii. 6, and xiv. 2.&nbsp; In chap. vii. 6, we read, &lsquo;The
Lord thy God hath chosen thee to be a <i>special</i> people unto
himself,&rsquo; and in chap. xiv. 2, &lsquo;The Lord hath chosen
thee to be a <i>peculiar</i> people unto himself.&rsquo;&nbsp;
You see that these words respecting Israel of old exactly
correspond to those here spoken of the redeemed Church, and <a
name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>they
completely explain what is here meant by the word
&lsquo;peculiar.&rsquo;&nbsp; As Israel was a peculiar people,
delivered from Egypt, and set apart unto God, so those who are in
Christ Jesus are redeemed from the old bondage of their past
lawlessness, and set apart as a special people unto Him who has
redeemed them by His blood.</p>
<p>Observe then the three characteristics of this new service,
the service of the redeemed.</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; It is the service of the Redeemer Himself.&nbsp; In
redeeming us from iniquity He makes us His own, and sets us apart
unto Himself.&nbsp; If redeemed we belong to the Redeemer.&nbsp;
We love Him, we follow Him, we serve Him, we are His.</p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; It is a pure service.</p>
<p>He does not merely separate, but purifies us unto
Himself.&nbsp; He carries on such a sacred work in the soul, and
effects such a marvellous change that the words of St. John are
realised, &lsquo;Every one that hath this hope in him purifieth
himself, even as he is pure,&rsquo; and that we even know
something of the blessing which He described in the words,
&lsquo;Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see
God.&rsquo;</p>
<p>(3.)&nbsp; It is a zealous and active service.</p>
<p>If we are thus redeemed we are not to sit <a
name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>still, and
quietly rejoice in a holy abandonment of soul; but we are to be
up and doing.&nbsp; There is a great work to be done for God, and
who is to do it if they are idle whom the Lord has
redeemed?&nbsp; We want no slothful, listless, inactive,
self-indulgent believers.&nbsp; Our missions are crippled for the
want of help; and our work at home sometimes seems paralyzed by
the lukewarmness of professors.&nbsp; But those who are brought
near to God, and purified as a peculiar people unto Himself, must
be filled with zeal for His service; for the lukewarm professor
is a scandal to the Church of God.&nbsp; The object of the
Lord&rsquo;s death was to call out a zealous people; and when
there is no zeal, there is no effective result from the cross,
for the purified people, redeemed by His grace, will, according
to the text, be &lsquo;zealous of good works.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now all this is a work at this present time in progress.&nbsp;
It is not, like the atonement, complete, but is going on
now.&nbsp; It is at this present time in progress in the
Church.&nbsp; The people who form the purchased possession are
being daily gathered in to God.&nbsp; He has not yet accomplished
the number of His elect.&nbsp; The body of Christ is not yet
perfected, and our earnest desire <a name="page151"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 151</span>is that day by day, yes, this very
day, immortal souls may be delivered from the power of darkness,
and translated into the kingdom of His dear Son.&nbsp; So also is
it progressive in the soul of each individual.&nbsp; We are not
suddenly wafted into perfection, or made pure as Christ is
pure.&nbsp; This chapter is a very clear proof of that, for while
it speaks of the great purpose of the Lord&rsquo;s death, viz.,
to redeem us from all iniquity it is full of exhortations to all
classes amongst us against practical misconduct.&nbsp; It is
perfectly clear, therefore, that the deliverance is not yet
complete.&nbsp; There is temptation around and temptation within;
sin in the world and sin in our own hearts; corruption in society
and corruption in our own nature; so that even after we have
actually experienced redeeming grace, we may say, as St. Paul
did, &lsquo;Who shall deliver me from the body of this
death?&rsquo; (Rom. vii. 24.)</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>II.&nbsp; This leads to our second subject, the redemption
power.</p>
<p>The redemption power is the Redeemer Himself, and so, as
pointed out in a previous lecture, the Lord Jesus is called in
Isaiah, lix. 20, &lsquo;the Redeemer,&rsquo; and in the quotation
of that passage <a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
152</span>Rom. xi. 26, &lsquo;the Deliverer.&rsquo;&nbsp; And
this applies whichever way you understand the words.&nbsp; If you
apply them to the curse of sin it is He that delivers from that
curse by the satisfaction of the law through His precious
blood.&nbsp; He paid the ransom, and in the Father&rsquo;s name
He has set us free.&nbsp; Or, if you apply it to the bondage of
lawlessness, it is equally He that delivers, for it is just as
much His office to release from the dominion of sin by the power
of the Holy Ghost as it was to remove the curse.&nbsp; In either
sense the passage brings Him before us as a present living
Deliverer, not merely one who has given Himself for us, but one
who is now engaged in actually delivering us from all iniquity
and purifying unto Himself a peculiar people.&nbsp; The first
clause, &lsquo;He gave himself for us,&rsquo; describes His work
on the cross finished at once and for ever; the latter part,
&lsquo;That He might redeem us from all iniquity,&rsquo; His
present work as a risen and living Saviour, continuously employed
in delivering and purifying His Church.&nbsp; Whatever we may
think of the clause, &lsquo;that he might redeem us from all
iniquity,&rsquo; this is clearly the meaning of the words that He
might &lsquo;purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of
good works.&rsquo;&nbsp; So <a name="page153"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 153</span>that either way we are brought to
the indisputable and most important lesson, that in our great
struggle against sin, either without or within; either in the
world or in our own hearts; and in our efforts to aim at the
practical Christian life exhibited in this chapter, we may take
the greatest possible encouragement from the fact that it is the
present office of our living Lord to deliver and to purify.&nbsp;
We may be profoundly conscious of the deep, inbred corruption of
our own nature.&nbsp; We may know by bitter experience how often
we have failed; we may be humbled to the dust at the thought of
our shortcomings; we may be ready to say, as St. Paul did,
&lsquo;Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?&rsquo;
but in the midst of it all we may look up in peaceful trust, and
thank God for the delivering power that is in Christ Jesus, our
risen and living Head.&nbsp; We may say as St. Paul did, &lsquo;I
thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But there is one thing which we must be sure to
remember.&nbsp; The purifying power depends entirely on the
reconciling blood.&nbsp; According to this text, in order that He
might redeem and purify, He first gave Himself for us; or, in
other words, in order that He might deliver, He first <a
name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>made
satisfaction for sin by bearing its burden Himself.&nbsp; We may,
therefore, be perfectly sure of this, that we shall never know
His power as a deliverer unless we first know the power of His
atonement.&nbsp; Not one amongst us could ever have been
delivered if the curse of God had not first been removed, and
that curse of God could never have been removed except by the
fact that the Son of God became a curse for us.&nbsp; Till that
was done there was no hope of deliverance, and till that is
applied or appropriated there is no hope of personal
holiness.&nbsp; Before the special, or peculiar, people could be
purified unto Himself, they must be set free from the curse, and
redeemed through the power of His blood.&nbsp; Not one of that
people has the curse of God still resting on his soul, for so
long as the curse remains it is perfectly impossible that any one
of us should be one of the people.&nbsp; While, therefore, you
trust in a Saviour living to deliver, be sure you keep well in
view that same Saviour having died to atone.&nbsp; His life will
be nothing to you unless you first know His death.&nbsp; You will
never experience the power of His work in you until you realise
His most gracious work completed for you on the cross.&nbsp; That
blotting out of sin <a name="page155"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 155</span>through the precious blood of the
Lamb must lie at the foundation of all true holiness.&nbsp; It is
the rock on which we stand, and unless there be a sure standing
ground there is not the slightest hope of progress.&nbsp; If,
therefore, you wish to press onward, and earnestly desire to be
heart and soul holy to the Lord, and I am sure I am speaking to
many that do, be sure you keep close to the great old foundation
truths.&nbsp; Trust your living Lord as your living
Deliverer.&nbsp; Accept His promises of the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s
power in all their fulness and throw yourself on Him for their
complete fulfilment; but while you do so remember that the one
power which in the purpose of God could remove the curse was the
atoning blood, and the one hope of your being partaker of the
deliverance rests altogether on the one fact that the great God
our Saviour in boundless mercy gave Himself for you.</p>
<h2><a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
156</span>XIII.&nbsp; RESTORATION.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;And when these things begin to come to
pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption
draweth nigh.&rsquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Luke</span>, xxi.
28.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is perfectly clear that the
redemption alluded to in these words is something still
future.&nbsp; It is the bright hope which is to cheer the little
flock through the storms of the latter days.&nbsp; When the world
is full of perplexity, and men&rsquo;s hearts are failing them
for fear, the Lord&rsquo;s people are to look up in calm, happy,
peaceful, trusting hope in the full assurance of their
approaching redemption.&nbsp; &lsquo;When these things begin to
come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your
redemption draweth nigh.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is perfectly clear,
therefore, that our Lord was not speaking of the great redeeming
act which took place eighteen hundred years ago on Calvary, but
of the final deliverance, the completion <a
name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>of His
redeeming work, when He will come in His kingdom and set His
people free.&nbsp; This final deliverance must be our subject in
this lecture.&nbsp; May the Lord bless it to our souls, and grant
that, when the time comes, we may be amongst those who rejoice in
the blessing!</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I.&nbsp; The redemption here spoken of is the deliverance of
Jerusalem.&nbsp; We must not isolate the passage from its
context, or forget that the words were spoken to Jewish
believers.&nbsp; Thus up to the end of the 24th verse our Lord
foretold the destruction of Jerusalem with the terrible
afflictions that were to precede it, concluding with the words,
&lsquo;Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the
times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then follows the
description of the latter days, and all the perils preceding the
advent, concluding with the words, &lsquo;Look up, and lift up
your heads, for your redemption draweth nigh.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Surely, then, there is a connexion between the 24th and 28th
verses.&nbsp; The one describes the desolation, and the other the
recovery: the one the bondage, the other the freedom; the one the
captivity, the other the deliverance; the one the iron yoke <a
name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>on the neck
of the captive, and the other the glorious restoration when the
Deliverer shall appear in Zion.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>II.&nbsp; But though the passage refers to the restoration of
Jerusalem, it clearly does not stop there, but includes the
redemption or deliverance of the Church.&nbsp; When I speak of
the Church I am not speaking of those who have nothing more than
outward Christianity: but of the Church of the first-born, that
Church described in the words, Eph. v. 25, &lsquo;Christ also
loved the Church, and gave himself for it, that he might sanctify
and cleanse it with the washing of water by the
word.&rsquo;&nbsp; This Church is described in Eph. i. 14, as His
&lsquo;purchased possession,&rsquo; and all the members of it are
now His own.&nbsp; They are His own by virtue of the ransom of
the eternal covenant, and it is therefore called, Acts, xx. 28,
&lsquo;The Church of God which he purchased with his own
blood.&rsquo;&nbsp; And they are His own by the call of the Holy
Ghost, gathering them out from a wicked world, and by His divine
power incorporating them into Christ.&nbsp; Thus in one sense
they have been redeemed already, for the ransom has been given
for their <a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
159</span>life, and they have found forgiveness through His
precious blood.&nbsp; They may say, every one of them, as St.
Paul did in the 7th verse of that same chapter in the Ephesians,
&lsquo;In whom we have redemption through his blood, the
forgiveness of sins.&rsquo;&nbsp; But yet, according to the 13th
verse, they are still waiting for redemption, and during the
waiting time are solemnly sealed unto God, and assured of what is
to come by the present earnest of the Spirit.&nbsp; &lsquo;In
whom also, after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy
Spirit of promise;&rsquo; and so, in chap. iv. 30, they are told
not to grieve the Holy Spirit, by whom they are &lsquo;sealed
unto the day of redemption.&rsquo;&nbsp; There is, therefore,
hereafter to be a redemption of the purchased possession, a
redemption of that which has already been redeemed, or, in other
words, a final deliverance of the ransomed Church.&nbsp; The
ransom is paid, but the time is not yet come for the ransomed
Bride to be finally free, and presented to her Lord in glory.</p>
<p>It is delightful to look forward to this coming restoration
when we think of the present position of the Church of God
surrounded as it is by a wicked world outside, and, what is far
more painful, harassed by division, false doctrine, <a
name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
160</span>inconsistency, and formalism within.&nbsp; I am not
surprised that St. Paul compares this present waiting time to the
night, for there is a great deal all around us exceedingly dark,
but we must never forget the approaching morning.&nbsp; We may be
greatly distressed by witnessing such defects and difficulties as
we do witness in the Church of Christ, but according to this
passage we need not be disheartened, for our redemption draweth
nigh.&nbsp; The Deliverer will soon come to Zion, and there will
be no difficulties then.&nbsp; The Redeemer Himself will soon set
all things straight.&nbsp; There will be complete light when the
Sun of Righteousness arises with healing in His wings.&nbsp; We
are not, therefore, going to be downcast by difficulties, or to
doubt His truth because we see His prophecies fulfilled; but,
whatever happens, whether persecution from without, or false
teaching within, we will remember His own most assuring words,
and act on them, &lsquo;When these things begin to come to pass,
then look up and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth
nigh.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>III.&nbsp; It will be a redemption of the body.&nbsp; I need
not stop to prove that the body is not <a
name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>yet free
from the bondage of the curse.&nbsp; Though the soul is free in
Christ Jesus the poor body is still subject as much as ever to
the strong hand of death.&nbsp; So we read, Rom. viii. 10,
&lsquo;If Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin, but
the spirit is life because of righteousness.&rsquo;&nbsp; So
that, even when Christ is in us, and the Spirit is life, the body
still remains dead, subject to death, and actually dying as we
all well know.&nbsp; The brightest and holiest living believers
are not exempt from the trials of a death-stricken body.</p>
<p>But if this is the case with the living Church, how much more
is it with the vast multitude of those who are now asleep in
Jesus!&nbsp; Think of the noble line of the saints of God who
were once, as we are, serving God on earth in the flesh, but who
are now in the condition, to us quite inexplicable, of
disembodied spirits, with the soul resting before God while the
poor body in utter weakness lies prostrate in the grave.&nbsp; I
cannot imagine a more marvellous contrast than that which now
exists between the present condition of the two parts of man
while awaiting the resurrection of the dead.&nbsp; It is
impossible to imagine any thing more utter, more complete, <a
name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>more
hopeless, than the bondage and subjection of the body; or more
blessed, more peaceful, more joyous, than the present rest of the
soul in the presence of the Lord Himself.&nbsp; But when the
redemption takes place, as predicted in this verse, the body
itself will be set free.&nbsp; You will see this in a moment if
you connect two verses in Rom. viii.&nbsp; From ver. 10 we have
already found that, even when the Spirit is life because of
righteousness, the body is still dead because of sin; and the
result is, as you read ver. 23, that even those who have the
first-fruits of the Spirit groan within themselves.&nbsp; They
share in respect of death the groaning of a death-stricken
world.&nbsp; But in the midst of it all they can rise above it in
triumphant hope, for they are waiting, and looking out for
deliverance, as you read in the latter part of that verse,
&lsquo;Waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of the
body.&rsquo;&nbsp; The body therefore shall be redeemed and rise
again.&nbsp; They that are in the graves shall hear His voice,
and shall come forth; and the very sea shall give up the dead
that are in it.&nbsp; I know that men say it is impossible, and I
know that there are difficulties connected with the subject which
to the eye of man appear to prove its impossibility; <a
name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>but there
is no such thing as impossibility with God.&nbsp; He who created
can restore.&nbsp; He who said, &lsquo;Let there be light,&rsquo;
and there was light, He can say &lsquo;Let there be life,&rsquo;
and there will be life.&nbsp; So that, although to us death is
quite irresistible; though no wealth can ward it off, and no
physician&rsquo;s skill can baffle it; and although, when once it
has taken place, all human hope is gone for ever; yet, when the
Redeemer comes to Zion, death itself will be powerless: those
dear ones who now sleep in the grave will come forth in risen
bodies at the bidding of their blessed Saviour; and He, the
gentle, and loving, and tender Lord Jesus, will fulfil His grand
prophecy as given by the prophet Hosea (xiii. 14), &lsquo;I will
ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from
death.&nbsp; O death, I will be thy plagues!&nbsp; O grave, I
will be thy destruction; repentance shall be hid from mine
eyes.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>IV.&nbsp; There will be a redemption of the soul, <i>i.e.</i>
a completion of that sacred work now being carried on in the soul
through the power of the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; There is clearly a
wide difference between the sacred work of deliverance as <a
name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>carried on
in the body and the soul; for the deliverance of the body is not
yet begun, but will be accomplished in one sudden act when the
Lord shall appear.&nbsp; But it is not so with the soul; for in
it the deliverance has been long since begun, and is day by day
being carried out by the power of the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; Our
blessed Lord has already delivered us, if we be in Him, both from
the curse and dominion of sin: from the curse, for &lsquo;we have
redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins;&rsquo; and
from the dominion, for &lsquo;sin shall not have dominion over
you, for ye are not under the law but under grace.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Rom. vi. 14.&nbsp; If, therefore, we are in Christ Jesus, and
under grace, our soul is delivered from the dominion of sin,
though our body is not yet delivered from the dominion of
death.&nbsp; You may ask, then, how it is that the soul still
wants deliverance?&nbsp; Look at the 12th verse of the sixth of
Romans, only two verses before the one just quoted, and you read,
&lsquo;Let not sin, therefore, reign in your mortal body, that ye
should fulfil it in the lusts thereof.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is,
therefore, there, though it must not reign.&nbsp; It has life in
it, and it is prepared to reign, but it must be put down.&nbsp;
It has its lusts and desires, but they <a
name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>must be
mortified, and not fulfilled.&nbsp; The power of sin is not
extinct or quiescent, but in full vigour still.&nbsp; The old
original corruption is not destroyed, but remains in full
activity.&nbsp; The grace of God triumphs over it, but it is
there; and there, not in a state of death, but of life and
vigour.&nbsp; If you think you have done with sin you will find
it will soon crop up, if in no other form, in pride of heart, and
blindness to its power.&nbsp; We can therefore perfectly
understand the complete harmony of the two verses in Rom. vii.,
that are sometimes thought contradictory: verse 6, in which he
says, &lsquo;Now we are delivered from the law,&rsquo; and verse
24, &lsquo;Who shall deliver me from the body of this
death?&rsquo;&nbsp; From the law, as involving the curse, we are
already free; from the infection of a ruined nature we are still
waiting to be delivered.&nbsp; And think for a moment what a
deliverance that will be.&nbsp; Ye that have been deeply humbled
at the discovery of your own utter unworthiness, ye that would
describe yourselves as St. Paul did as &lsquo;the chief of
sinners,&rsquo; and &lsquo;less than the least of all
saints,&rsquo; think what it would be to be set at once
absolutely free from indwelling sin.&nbsp; Picture to yourselves
the day of His coming.&nbsp; Think of <a name="page166"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 166</span>yourself on your knees in the
morning, confessing sin, and praying for pardon and for help, for
mercy and for grace.&nbsp; And then think of yourself at night,
having in the course of the day beheld Christ as He is, and
having been so transformed by the sight that you have become
altogether like Him, without a single temptation or difficulty
left, and with every stain and tendency to sin rooted out, and
gone for ever.&nbsp; But this is what we are led to expect in
these words of St. John: &lsquo;Beloved, now are we the sons of
God; and it doth not yet appear what we shall be, but we know
that when he shall appear we shall be like him, for we shall see
him as he is.&rsquo;&nbsp; No wonder, then, that with such a hope
in view our Lord directs us, even in the midst of the fears and
perplexities of the latter days, to look up, and lift up our
head, for our redemption draweth nigh.</p>
<p>But one thing we must remember.&nbsp; We shall never rejoice
in the redemption or deliverance that is to come, till we can
rest in the redemption or atonement that is complete.&nbsp; There
are many amongst us, I sadly fear, who find no pleasure in the
thought of the Lord&rsquo;s return, and in many cases there can
be no doubt about <a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
167</span>the reason.&nbsp; They have found no peace through His
cross.&nbsp; I believe that no one ever cares for the Lord Jesus
Christ as a Deliverer from either death or sin till He knows Him
as the Redeemer from the curse.&nbsp; No man can look up and lift
up his head if he expects to rise again to the resurrection of
damnation, and to be cast forth for ever with all the guilt of
all His sin on his miserable head.&nbsp; Therefore it is that,
till you know the atonement by blood, you will never care for the
deliverance by power.&nbsp; Till you know the sufficiency of the
ransom you are sure to dread the coming of the Deliverer, as, I
fear, too many do.&nbsp; Look backwards, then, as well as
forwards, I most earnestly entreat you.&nbsp; Accept the
assurance of the coming deliverance in all its fulness.&nbsp;
Accept it in all its joy.&nbsp; Rejoice in the blessed
hope.&nbsp; But take care; and while you look forward in the hope
that your redemption draweth nigh, remember also to look back on
that finished atonement, and never rest till you can appropriate
these words to the Ephesians, &lsquo;In whom we have redemption
through his blood, the forgiveness of sins.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One word before we close respecting the sacred feast of the
Lord&rsquo;s supper, in which it is <a name="page168"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 168</span>our sacred privilege as believers to
gather round the table of our Lord.&nbsp; It is a connecting link
between the two parts of redemption, the atonement and the
deliverance, the cross and the advent.&nbsp; In it we look
backwards and forwards, as we are taught 1 Cor. xi. 26:
backwards, for we show the Lord&rsquo;s death; and forwards, for
we do so &lsquo;till He come.&rsquo;&nbsp; When He does so, we
shall sit down with Him at the marriage supper of the Lamb, and
our symbolic service will cease in the realisation of the fulness
of His blessing.&nbsp; Oh! how I pity those who are moved neither
by memory or hope, by the recollection of what He has done, or
the hope of what He is about to do; who never show the
Lord&rsquo;s death according to His own appointment, and never
act as if they were waiting for His coming!</p>
<h2><a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
169</span>XIV.&nbsp; HEAVEN.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art
worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou
wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every
kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation.&rsquo;&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Rev</span>. v. 9.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the preceding lectures it has
been my privilege to direct attention to the important subject of
redemption, and I think we cannot do better in closing the series
than examine in this lecture what they think of it in
heaven.&nbsp; They know there more than we do here, for they have
passed within the veil, and they know by experience those great
and most blessed results which we can only anticipate in
faith.&nbsp; In their case sight has taken the place of hope, and
through redeeming grace they are in actual enjoyment of the
visible presence of God.&nbsp; Of course, therefore, they are
better able than we can be to form a just estimate of what the
Lord Jesus has done for their salvation.&nbsp; Let us <a
name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>then devote
this morning to the study of what they think of redeeming
love.</p>
<p>We all know very well what a natural craving there is to look
in beyond the veil, and to see what is passing amongst those who
have already entered.&nbsp; What would we give for one
half-hour&rsquo;s intercourse, or for even a telescopic view of
that happy assembly now gathered before the throne?&nbsp; What
would it be to us if for one short minute we could see the
heavens opened?&nbsp; But something of this kind was permitted to
St. John, as we read, chap. iv. 1, &lsquo;A door was opened in
heaven,&rsquo; and a voice said, &lsquo;Come up
hither.&rsquo;&nbsp; Immediately he was in the Spirit, and having
entered he saw some of those very things which we long to see,
but which no other living man has ever been able to see, and to
report.&nbsp; St. Paul may have seen them when he was caught up
to the third heaven, but if he did, he was not permitted to tell
us what he saw.&nbsp; But St. John was expressly employed to do
so.&nbsp; He was distinctly commanded to write the things which
he had seen, and this book is the result.</p>
<p>What, then, did he see?&nbsp; He saw in the first place a
throne, and on the throne one sitting.&nbsp; Round about the
throne were twenty-four seats, <a name="page171"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 171</span>and &lsquo;upon the seats four and
twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment; and they had on
their heads crowns of gold.&rsquo;&nbsp; But besides the elders
there was a marvellous manifestation of spiritual life,
inexplicable to us who have no experience of the life of a spirit
without the body: for in chap. iv. 6, we read, that &lsquo;in the
midst of the throne,&rsquo; and round about the throne, were four
living ones.&nbsp; These living ones were clearly in the most
intimate relationship with the throne and with Him who sat on
it.&nbsp; They were as near to it and to Him as was possible, for
they were in the midst of it, and round about it, while in an
outer circle stood a vast host of angels.&nbsp; From chap. v. 11,
we see clearly that these angels were in an outer circle, not so
near the throne as the living ones, for there we read: &lsquo;I
beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the
throne, and the living ones, and the elders, and the number of
them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of
thousands.&rsquo;&nbsp; In this description the only real
difficulty is with reference to the elders and living ones, for
we are not distinctly informed who they were.&nbsp; According to
the reading of ver. 9 and ver. 10, as given us in our dear old
English Bible, it appears <a name="page172"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 172</span>perfectly plain that together they
formed the company of those whose ransomed souls are now resting
before the throne, for they said in their hymn, &lsquo;Thou hast
redeemed <i>us</i> by thy blood . . . And hast made <i>us</i>
unto our God kings and priests.&rsquo;&nbsp; But there seems to
be a doubt about that &lsquo;<i>us</i>,&rsquo; and, therefore, we
must not rely too much on it.&nbsp; But on the whole there is
reason to believe that the vast multitude of happy spirits now
before God awaiting the resurrection, are represented by this
inner circle of elders and living ones already brought as near as
possible to the throne, and surrounded by the vast company of
angels, who, having been sent forth to minister unto them during
their pilgrimage, can rejoice without jealousy in their
blessedness, even though they are placed in a position of greater
honour than themselves.</p>
<p>But our business in this lecture is not to discuss the persons
seen in heaven, but rather to examine what they think of
redemption, to learn how far their account of it agrees with our
own, and to find in what estimation they hold the redeeming
work.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I.&nbsp; Their account, or description of it.&nbsp; Does <a
name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>the account
which they give in their hymn agree with the account which we
have gathered from the rest of Scripture?&nbsp; I think it does
exactly, and I would ask you to notice four points.</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; They speak of redemption as a deliverance.&nbsp; We
have found throughout the Word of God that to redeem is not
merely to make atonement, but to deliver by means of a
ransom.&nbsp; In all the passages that we have examined it has
included the idea of actual deliverance.&nbsp; It has never been
applied to the act of propitiation alone.&nbsp; Now turn to this
hymn of the elders and living ones before the throne, and there
you see precisely the same idea: &lsquo;Thou hast redeemed us to
God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people,
and nation.&rsquo;&nbsp; There was an act of outgathering and
ingathering.&nbsp; They were gathered out as a separate people
from all nations of the earth, and gathered in to be a peculiar
people unto God.&nbsp; The passage reminds us of those words in
John, xi. 52, which teach us that the great object of the death
of the Lord Jesus was, &lsquo;that he should gather together in
one the children of God that were scattered abroad.&rsquo;&nbsp;
So this heavenly hymn describes them as being thus gathered in
one before the throne.</p>
<p><a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
174</span>(2.)&nbsp; It is a redemption through the most precious
blood of the Lamb.</p>
<p>The deliverance, or the gathering, is not simply an exercise
of power, but is the result of atonement by blood.&nbsp; It is
not merely the act of the Holy Ghost calling the sinner, but the
act of God making atonement, or giving Christ to die for
him.&nbsp; Before one soul could be drawn out from the ruin of
the world, and gathered in to God, the barrier of the curse must
be taken out of the way, and the law satisfied by its complete
fulfilment in the Person of our Redeeming Head.&nbsp; Till the
ransom was paid not one soul could be set free, and therefore the
hymn says, &lsquo;Thou hast redeemed us to God by thy
blood.&rsquo;</p>
<p>(3.)&nbsp; They are raised to a position far above a mere
pardon.&nbsp; We learned when we studied the case of Ruth that
the redeemed are not merely delivered from ruin, but brought to a
position of the highest possible honour, for the ransomed Church
becomes the Bride of the Redeemer, and is identified with Christ
Himself.&nbsp; So here you observe that the redeemed are not
merely forgiven, but they are raised to new honours, new powers,
new service, and new glory.&nbsp; &lsquo;Thou hast made us unto
our God <a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
175</span>kings and priests, and we shall reign on the
earth.&rsquo;&nbsp; I have not time to dwell on the sacred
blessedness of that royal priesthood.&nbsp; It combines the
honours of the king and the service of the priest.&nbsp; It is a
kind of reflection of the double office of the Lord Himself, of
whom it is said, &lsquo;He shall sit and rule upon his throne,
and shall be a priest upon his throne.&rsquo;&nbsp; The redeemed
are made kings under Him to govern, and priests in Him, and
through Him, to present a holy service unto God.&nbsp; Do not be
satisfied, therefore, to let your mind dwell exclusively on the
first elementary subject of forgiveness.&nbsp; I know the
importance of it, and know well that there can be no such thing
as peace until you can trust for a pardon.&nbsp; But I am
speaking to those who can trust for forgiveness, who have learned
the power of redeeming blood, and who are now resting in the
assurance of the blotting out of sin.&nbsp; To them I say, Go
forward, and accept your new position, acknowledge your high
calling, carry out your royal priesthood, and never forget that
you are anointed, and set apart as kings and priests unto
God.</p>
<p>(4.) This leads me to the fourth point, that we are redeemed
unto God.</p>
<p><a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>We
found from the study of St. Paul&rsquo;s words to Titus that our
most blessed Saviour redeemed us to be a peculiar, or special
people unto Himself, so that all God&rsquo;s redeemed are
sanctified, or set apart, unto Him.&nbsp; This is exactly what is
taught in the hymn of heaven, for there we learn that we are
redeemed, not merely from sin, but unto God.&nbsp; &lsquo;Thou
hast redeemed us unto God by thy blood.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;We
are made kings and priests unto God.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is true of
the believer, as it is of the Lord Jesus Himself, that &lsquo;In
that he liveth he liveth unto God.&rsquo;&nbsp; By atonement
every barrier is broken down, and the way of access laid open
even to the very throne of God Himself; and by the call of the
Holy Ghost we are set apart unto God, to bear His name, to live
as His sons, to do His will, to act as His witnesses, and to be
as it were His representatives in the midst of a wicked
world.&nbsp; We are not redeemed simply in order that we may be
saved, but in order also that God may be glorified.&nbsp; As
God&rsquo;s chosen people we are brought near to God Himself, in
order that we may go forth into life, to glorify His name.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>II.&nbsp; It is clear, therefore, that the account <a
name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>given in
heaven of the work of redemption is exactly the same as that
which is taught us throughout the word of God.&nbsp; Let us pass
on to consider what is the heavenly estimate of the sacred work,
or in other words, What do they think of it there?&nbsp; What
value do they set on it?</p>
<p>First.&nbsp; What do the elders and the living ones think of
it?&nbsp; The chapter contains the description of a remarkable
scene in connexion with a certain book, which was seen in the
right hand of Him that sat on the throne.&nbsp; A strong angel
proclaims with a loud voice, &lsquo;Who is worthy to open the
book, and to loose the seals thereof?&rsquo;&nbsp; But &lsquo;no
man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to
open the book, and to loose the seals thereof.&rsquo;&nbsp; There
was something so sacred about it, that no man was found worthy
even to look on it, and the result was that St. John wept
much.&nbsp; Some people seem to care very little whether the book
of God is closed or not; but he shed many tears when the sacred
book seemed closed to his view.&nbsp; But one of those elders who
sat around the throne said, &lsquo;Weep not: behold the Lion of
the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the
book, and to loose <a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
178</span>the seven seals thereof.&rsquo;&nbsp; So he
beheld.&nbsp; He looked for the Lion, but when he looked there
stood a Lamb, a Lamb as it had been slain, the Lord Jesus Christ,
our Redeemer; and He came, and took the book out of the right
hand of Him that sat on the throne.&nbsp; It was this that called
forth this hymn of praise from the living ones, and that led them
to sing a new song, saying, &lsquo;Thou art worthy to take the
book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and
hast redeemed us to God by thy blood.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now observe
that hymn, and note carefully what it was that in their sight
constituted the worthiness of the Lamb.&nbsp; It was not His
Divine Sonship; not His pre-existence as God; not His eternal and
unspotted perfection; not His present exaltation to the right
hand of the Father&rsquo;s throne: but it was the fact that, in
order to redeem, He had been slain.&nbsp; It was the great act of
redemption that gave Him a worthiness far beyond that of any
other either in heaven or earth.&nbsp; He was honoured with an
honour far above anything ever known, even in heaven, and the
reason was that as a Redeemer He had died.&nbsp; If you ask,
then, What is heaven&rsquo;s estimate of <i>redemption</i>? the
answer is, That it is thought <a name="page179"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 179</span>there to be so gracious, so
wonderful, so divine, that it brings more honour to the Lord
Jesus than all the other glories of His most glorious
eternity.</p>
<p>But what do the angels think of it?&nbsp; They are
disinterested witnesses.&nbsp; If the living ones are the spirits
resting before the throne, they have been saved by it; and,
therefore, of course they have their deep personal interest in
it.&nbsp; But it is not so with the angels.&nbsp; They never
fell, so they have had no need of redemption, and can only regard
it as a work wrought out for others.&nbsp; But there is no
selfishness apparent in their spirit.&nbsp; I often think that
the great charm of the angels&rsquo; character is their complete
unselfishness.&nbsp; So there was nothing selfish about their
song, for though they were only lookers-on, or rather ministers,
though they could not say, as we can, &lsquo;Thou hast redeemed
us,&rsquo; though not one of their number was saved through the
redeeming blood, yet the whole vast multitude joined heart and
soul in the adoration of redeeming mercy, and as soon as the hymn
of the living ones was brought to a close, they all burst forth
in their own song of praise, and said with a loud voice,
&lsquo;Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and
riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and
blessing.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>But
the worship did not stop even with them.&nbsp; St. Paul teaches
us that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain
together until now, for the whole is affected by the fall; and
that a time is coming when, through redeeming grace, the creature
itself shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the
glorious liberty of the children of God.&nbsp; No wonder, then,
that creation itself is here represented as taking part in the
joy of redemption.&nbsp; The whole creation is described as
catching the spirit of praise.&nbsp; The living ones and the
angels were not allowed to have a monopoly of thanksgiving, and,
therefore, as soon as the angels&rsquo; hymn was ended there was
a grand outburst of praise from the whole creation of God:
&lsquo;And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth,
and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are
in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and
power, be unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the
Lamb, for ever and ever.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And now, dear brethren, what shall we do?&nbsp; Shall we go
home indifferent to the subject?&nbsp; Shall we, whose life
depends altogether on redemption leave it as a thing uncared
for?&nbsp; Shall <a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
181</span>there be no note of praise from us?&nbsp; Ye that know
redeeming grace, shall there be no hymn of praise from you?&nbsp;
Surely we must not wait till we see Him on the throne, and hear
the hymn of the living ones.&nbsp; Those who are on earth
according to this passage are to join in the chorus, so we will
lose no time in doing so; and before we leave the church we will
unite in the grand old hymn&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Come, let us join our cheerful songs<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With angels round the throne;<br />
Ten thousand thousand are their tongues,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But all their joys are one.</p>
<p>Worthy the Lamb that died, they cry,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To be exalted thus;<br />
Worthy the Lamb our lips reply,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For he was slain for us.&rsquo;</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
